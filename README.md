History of work that I have written and completed

In this repository we have many pieces of work that I have coded. These include many AI algorithms and applications which were completed during my AI masters at Imperial, as well as a folder containing code I have completed which is related to music. The music code is mainly written in Matlab. I will briefly go through the different modules and explain the files that are inside them. 

Deep Learning: In this folder we have three scripts which contain tasks for many different aspects of deep learning. One script is focused on convolutional neural networks and their applications, one focuses on generative models such as VAEs, and the other is focused on RNN, LSTM and GRU networks and their applications. 

Machine Learning: Here we have two directories. One is on decision trees and their applications, and the other is on building a neural network from scratch to predict certain aspects of the insurance market.
