The crisis has resulted in extra pressure on services that support the most vulnerable: the elderly, disabled and homeless.\nAt the same time income from fees and charges has dried up, and there's fear that council tax revenues may fall as people face financial hardship.\nAt the start of this crisis, council leaders said they largely felt reassured by government promises of support. Now - with so much demand on the Treasury - there's scepticism about how much more funding will be forthcoming.\nLocal government, which often feels like a forgotten frontline service, wants to ensure its voice is heard among the calls for support. Hence this stark warning about the potential consequences for crucial services if it doesn't get more cash. \nThe LGA says councils are spending more on helping disabled, older and homeless people through the crisis, but are no longer raising money from leisure and planning services, which have been suspended.\nRichard Watts, chairman of the LGA's resources board, said: \"Additional funding is urgently needed to help councils get through this crisis, support the vulnerable and adapt to life once we defeat this virus, when our local services will be needed more than ever to help communities rebuild. \n\"It would be wrong and unacceptable if councils are then forced to make further cutbacks to the very services that will have helped the nation through this crisis and the key workers who are producing heroics on the front line see their jobs placed at risk.\"\nThe government has announced councils will be able to defer \u00a32.6bn in business rate payments owed to central government.\nA Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government spokesperson said: \"We've already provided \u00a31.6bn of additional funding and have announced new measures to help ease immediate cash flow pressures faced by councils in England.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52322447": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-52322447", "title": "Coronavirus testing to be rolled out to more public service staff", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 18:17:28 GMT", "summary": "Capacity is rising \"sharply\" but fewer NHS staff than expected are coming forward, Matt Hancock says.", "story": "Coronavirus testing will be rolled out to people working in public services such as police, fire and prison staff, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said.\nCapacity was rising \"sharply\" but not as many NHS staff had come forward for tests as had been expected, he said.\nThe government said 21,328 tests were carried out on Thursday but there had been capacity for at least 38,000. \nMeanwhile, scientists say they should have at least a million doses of a coronavirus vaccine by September. \nHowever, Business Secretary Alok Sharma said there were \"no guarantees\" and it was not possible to put a date on when a vaccine would be created by. \nProducing one is \"a colossal undertaking\" and \"a complex process which will take many months\", he told the government's daily press briefing.\nIt comes as the UK recorded 847 new coronavirus-related deaths in hospitals on Thursday, taking the total to 14,576. \nThe figure does not include hundreds more who have died in care homes and the community.\nSpeaking by videolink to an online meeting of the Commons health committee earlier, Mr Hancock said the government had prioritised testing for hospital patients and NHS workers before expanding it to residents and staff in social care.\nHe added some 50,000 NHS workers had been tested so far. \nHowever, he said it was \"frustrating\" there was capacity for 10,000 more tests a day than were carried out on Thursday. \nThe government has a target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April. \nEligibility for testing will also be expanded to critical local authority workers, the judiciary and Department for Work and Pensions staff, he said. \n\"We're able to do that because of the scale-up of testing,\" he added. \nMr Hancock said he hoped anyone with symptoms would be able to be tested \"relatively soon\". \n\"Now we've got the curve under control, I want to be able to get back to the position that we can test everybody with symptoms -

this is something that could have been easily avoided.\"\nMr Wrack said there were also issues around how accessible testing was, with many testing centres far out of town. \nDame Donna Kinnair, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, told the committee some sick NHS workers were compelled to drive for up to two hours to be tested.\nAlso speaking to the committee, Prof Anthony Costello, the director of University College London's Institute for Global Health, said there could be 40,000 deaths in the UK as a result of the coronavirus pandemic.\nHe said the UK had been \"too slow\" to react on a number of fronts to the crisis which may lead to it having \"probably the highest death rate in Europe\".\nSir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, previously said it would be a \"good outcome\" if total UK deaths could be kept below 20,000.\nWarning that the UK would face \"further waves\" of the virus, Prof Costello said a system needed to be put in place that \"cannot just do a certain number of tests in the laboratory\" but one that reached out at \"district and community level\".\nSpeaking at the briefing, Sir Patrick said there was beginning to be a \"gradual decrease\" in the number of coronavirus patients in London hospitals and a flattening or decrease in other areas. \n\"The numbers are not only at a plateau but beginning to come down in some areas and that will translate into fewer people in intensive care in due course,\" he said. \n\"But do not expect this to be quick. This is not going to be a sudden drop, there will be a plateau - it will take a while for the numbers to come right down and that's why it's important that we continue with the strong social distancing measures that we have in place.\"\nSir Patrick added that he unfortunately expected the number of coronavirus-related deaths to continue to plateau \"for a little while\" before starting to come down slowly. \nIn other developments:\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52328756": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52328756", "title": "Coronavirus: Britons warned against making summer holiday plans", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 16:12:44 GMT", "summary": "Current pandemic rules \"don't allow\" for UK breaks or non-essential foreign travel, No 10 says.", "story": "People should not book holidays until current social distancing rules are relaxed, Downing Street has suggested.\nNo 10 said official guidance designed to suppress the spread of coronavirus did \"not allow\" for non-essential travel within the UK or overseas.\nThe pandemic has severely curtailed air travel although UK airlines are looking at how to operate after the lockdown.\nTransport Secretary Grant Shapps said he would not book a summer break at the moment due to the current uncertainty.\nAsked during an interview on Radio 4's Today for his advice for people who would normally be considering their holiday plans, Mr Shapps said: \"Clearly people will want to see what the trajectory of this disease is in the next few weeks. \n\"We are not seeing declines yet.

tight on gowns and that is the pressure point.\" \nThe government has been criticised for not providing enough PPE for healthcare workers during the coronavirus crisis.\nFor a number of weeks, Prime Minister Boris Johnson and government ministers have said during press briefings and interviews that firms including Burberry will begin making personal protective equipment on behalf of the government as one of the answers to a critical shortage.\nAsked about the PPE produced by such manufacturers, Mr Hancock praised the \"national effort\" but urged more companies to come forward.\nMr Hancock said on Friday that PPE was a \"precious resource\" and that maintaining supplies was challenging due to the \"very high\" global demand.\nLatest statistics revealed the UK recorded another 861 coronavirus-related deaths in hospital, taking the total to 13,729. The overall figure does not include hundreds more who have died in residential and nursing homes.\nOn Thursday, as Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab announced the extension of lockdown restrictions for \"at least\" another three weeks, he said there remained \"issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and in care homes\".\nAmong five conditions he said must be met before curbs on daily life could be lifted were making sure the NHS could cope and ensuring PPE supplies could meet demand.\nIn other developments:\nLast week, Mr Hancock said there was \"enough PPE to go around, but only if it's used in line with our guidance\", adding there was a \"huge task\" to make sure those who need it get it.\nA gown is a piece of PPE used to protect the body of those who might come into contact with coronavirus.\nIt should be made of water-resistant material and have long sleeves. If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus.\nThe shortage of non-surgical gowns is a critical problem facing the NHS as it struggles to secure enough kit for frontline staff. \nA leaked Public Health England document this week advised health workers to reuse protective gowns and masks only as a \"last resort\".\nAs the world fights coronavirus, the demand for gowns is at levels never seen before. \nAlmost all of the UK's gowns used by the NHS are made in China and the Far East.\nThese decisions have been driven by cost, as all sectors seek the cheapest prices. \nBut as every country in the world fights for finite supplies, a UK solution has been sought. \nThe government and management consultancy Deloitte approached well known UK garment brands asking if they could help make PPE.\nThey also requested that UK manufacturers complete a survey to share what they could make.\nEarlier this week, Barbour began distributing gowns from its factory in the north-east of England.\nBurberry is still making the final adjustments to its factory and production is expected to start next week.\nGetting a supply chain formalised using UK factories has been difficult.\nUK garment factories approached by the BBC have said the government does not fully understand what is possible in the UK, and which firms could produce what. This lack of understanding has caused production delays.\nDelays around certification of gowns for use is also slowing down the manufacturing process.\nSome factories say it could be another two weeks before the necessary paperwork is signed off and they can manufacture the gowns.\nThis comes as factories around the UK are empty. Machinists and pattern cutters have been sent home and furloughed.\nTo add to the frustration of factory bosses, they say they're getting upsetting calls from NHS hospitals and workers begging for gowns.\nA Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Adequate supply of protective equipment is an international issue facing many countries during this global pandemic.\" \nNearly one billion pieces of protective equipment had been delivered to the frontline so far, the spokesman said.\n\"There is also a 24-hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report supply disruption. \n\"We continue to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment they need and it is crucial the guidance for protective equipment is followed closely,\" the spokesman added.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

A total of 14,576 people with the virus have died in hospital.\nApart from healthcare workers, the UK government has never advised people to wear face masks during this pandemic.\nIt has consistently said the scientific evidence for recommending them is weak, and on Thursday Prof Chris Whitty - the UK's chief medical adviser - repeated that point again.\nThe World Health Organization agrees. It says only two groups of people should wear protective masks - those who care for people with the coronavirus, and those who are sick and showing symptoms.\nIt believes masks aren't useful for the general public because they offer a false sense of security. Why? Because they don't necessarily protect against infection, particularly if homemade or loose-fitting, and they may encourage people not to follow other advice to keep 2m away from others and wash hands frequently.\nAt the moment, UK officials agree - but they can't stop people wearing them if they choose too, particularly shop workers who may find it difficult to socially distance.\nThey say they will now look at the evidence again.\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52299514": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52299514", "title": "Coronavirus: MPs and peers to quiz ministers via video conferencing", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 19:59:15 GMT", "summary": "MPs and peers plan to take part in some parliamentary business via video link.", "story": "Plans to allow MPs to take part in some parliamentary business virtually have been approved by the body responsible for administration in the Commons.\nThe House of Commons Commission said ministers will be quizzed via Zoom for the first time in the House's 700-year history.\nThis \"unprecedented step\" will \"keep democracy going\" during the coronavirus crisis, it said.\nMPs will have to approve the plan next week when they return on 21 April. \nIt means that up to 120 MPs will be able to take part in proceedings virtually at any one time, while 50 could remain in the chamber under social distancing rules.\nThe Commons authorities will mark out the 2m (6ft) distance MPs will have to maintain when they go into the chamber.\nThe House of Lords will also conduct some non-legislative debates remotely after guidance was changed by senior peers. \nThese will only be broadcast from early May, while debates on laws will initially continue in the chamber with the \"expectation of limited participation\".\nThe meeting of the House of Commons Commission on Thursday included Commons Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle, Commons Leader Jacob Rees-Mogg, shadow leader Valerie Vaz and the SNP's Pete Wishart.\nSpeaker Sir Lindsay, who chairs the commission, said: \"By initiating a hybrid solution, with steps towards an entirely virtual Parliament, we are enabling members to stay close to their communities, while continuing their important work scrutinising the government.\n\"I do not want members and House staff putting themselves at risk.\n\"By working virtually, this is our contribution to the guidance of stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.\"\nMr Rees-Mogg said: \"These measures will make it possible for Parliament to continue its work of conducting scrutiny, authorising spending and making laws -

It's important to say things could change as more information comes to light. \nBut, as things stand, it seems that the route out of this will be staggered, gradual and cautious.\nThe government's clear and ongoing priority will be to avoid overwhelming the NHS. Increased testing will be an essential part of tackling the infection. And meanwhile the country, and indeed the world, waits for what appears to be the ultimate way out - a vaccine.\nWith Labour calling on the government to publish plans for easing the lockdown, Mr Raab said they were being as \"open as we responsibly can\" but they could not \"prejudge\" the evidence that their scientific advisers would consider at the next review in three weeks' time.\nLabour leader Sir Keir Starmer said \"the government is right\" to extend the restrictions but he said any exit strategy would require mass testing in the community and it was \"struggling\" to reach its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April.\nThe UK now has the capacity to carry out 35,000 tests for coronavirus a day, Downing Street said, although the most recent figures showed they only carried out 18,665 in the last 24-hour period.\nSir Keir also told the BBC's podcast Coronavirus Newscast that he suspected Mr Raab was \"reluctant\" to sign off an exit strategy without the prime minister in office.\nAlso speaking at the briefing, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, played down suggestions that vulnerable groups such as the elderly could be kept under lockdown conditions for longer.\nHe said the aim was for \"everything to start moving more towards normal, not to segregate certain groups\".\nThe government's announcement in the UK comes after a meeting of the emergency Cobra committee, involving the first ministers of Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland.In Scotland, a further 80 people have died in hospitals. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the lockdown should continue because \"we are not confident enough that the virus has been suppressed sufficiently\". Wales recorded another 32 deaths, with First Minister Mark Drakeford saying it was \"still too early to change course\".Northern Ireland saw its highest daily toll, with a further 18 deaths in hospitals, and England recorded another 740 deaths.\nThe tallies for individual nations can differ from the UK-wide total, because they are calculated on a different timeframe.\nAt 20:00 BST for the fourth week running, people across the country gathered on doorsteps, balconies or in gardens to applaud workers in the NHS, care services and others helping during the crisis.\n\"It got really big, eh?\" said Annemarie Plas, a Dutch woman living in London who began the weekly Clap for Carers ritual. \"You can never say British people don't have passion and spirit.\"\nDowning Street said Boris Johnson, who continues to recover from Covid-19, joined in the applause to thank the \"incredible efforts\" of NHS and care workers.\nDuring the No 10 briefing, Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, urged people to continue to attend hospital if they needed to for other emergencies, saying the NHS \"is open for business\".\nIt comes after figures showed that visits to accident and emergency units have dropped sharply since the outbreak began.\nProf Whitty also said the government was reviewing whether there were any circumstances in which it should recommend people wear masks in public to prevent the virus spreading, but said \"the evidence is weak\" and it would be a \"very bad thing\" if increased demand created shortages for healthcare workers.\nBut London Mayor Sadiq Khan told the BBC he wanted people in the capital to wear masks or face coverings whenever they leave the house.\n\"The evidence around the world is that this is effective, and I'm lobbying our government, our advisers to change their advice, and I want us to do that sooner rather than later,\" he said.\nFollowing reports that black, Asian and minority ethnic people were critically ill in disproportionately high numbers, Downing Street said the NHS and Public Health England would carry out a review into whether some ethnicities were particularly at risk from the virus.\nProf Whitty said that it was \"absolutely critical\" to determine which groups were most at risk, but said the evidence on ethnicity was \"less clear\" at the moment than other factors, such as age, sex and underlying illnesses. \nSome countries across Europe which introduced lockdown measures before the UK are now beginning to ease them, including Austria, Italy and Germany. \nHowever, they continue to require some social distancing measures, which reduce close contact between people and prevent large gatherings.\nIn other developments:\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52318967": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52318967", "title": "Keir Starmer: I hated selling myself to party members", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 21:36:39 GMT", "summary": "The new Labour leader tells the BBC he is \"much more comfortable\" taking leadership decisions.", "story": "Sir Keir Starmer has said he \"hated selling myself\" to party members during his recent campaign to become Labour leader. \nHe told the BBC's Coronavirus Newscast he found the experience of going up against party colleagues \"very odd\". \nHe added it was \"the same in all political parties,\" but he was \"much more comfortable\" in a decision-taking role.\nSir Keir succeeded Jeremy Corbyn after a 12-week contest ending this month.\nThe 57-year-old former lawyer defeated Lisa Nandy and Rebecca Long-Bailey on the first round of voting, with more than 50% of ballots cast. \nSir Keir has given both his former rivals posts in his shadow cabinet team, in keeping with a commitment he made during the campaign. \nHe told the BBC: \"You're in your own party and you're up against colleagues, and very good colleagues, who you like.

They would not have to speak to a health advisor or wait for a medical test result.\nThis would send a cascade of alerts to people they had recently been in proximity to, advising them to go back into self-isolation.\nThe experts say \"speed is of the essence\", and that delaying contact tracing by even a day from the onset of symptoms could make the difference between epidemic control and resurgence.\n\"There would be more people receiving notifications as a result of false warnings,\" explained Prof Christophe Fraser.\n\"But actually, it results in fewer days of people in self-isolation and quarantine, because the effect of suppressing the epidemic more quickly outweighs the risks in waiting for a test before the notification.\" \nThe over-70s have not been factored in, on the basis they would remain \"shielded\" by staying at home, he added.\nThe Oxford University academics are a mix of epidemiologists and ethicists advising NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - on what basis the contact-tracing app should be created. They are not involved in coding or designing the software itself.\nTheir model takes into account different age groups, household structures and movement patterns in an effort to try to maximise the number of people who could be allowed to freely move about once a contact-tracing app has been launched.\n\"We're looking at introducing the app towards the end of lockdown,\" Prof Fraser added.\n\"When you install it, it needs a few days to start recording data before it can be fully functional.\"\nThe group first published a paper about its work at the end of March.\nSince then, they have adjusted their model to take account of changing factors, including the fact that Covid-19's infection rate has been faster than they had anticipated.\nThey have also changed plans from using a system that relied on GPS location readings and scanning QR codes to one that exclusively depends on Bluetooth signals. This has been done to provide users more privacy, which in turn could encourage take-up.\nThe hope is that using the app, as well as other measures such as hand-washing and social distancing from vulnerable members of the population, will prevent a second peak in infections or the need for repeated national lockdowns.\nThe team estimates that 56% of the general population must use the app to halt the outbreak. Prof Fraser said that equated to 80% of all existing smartphone owners, based on data from Ofcom.\n\"That's a very ambitious target,\" the professor acknowledged.\n\"It's not something that would typically happen for a new app - even an incredibly popular one - but if we can explain that this is a public health intervention, that will be new and different.\n\"Some of my colleagues have... commissioned large surveys in multiple European countries including the UK.\n\"More than 80% of people surveyed said they were likely to or would install this app when it was explained in detail what it would be doing.\"\nEven if fewer people install the app, the team estimates that one infection will be averted for every one to two users.\nThe Oxford team suggests that use of the tool should be voluntary. However, this will pose a challenge. \nOn 20 March, Singapore became one of the first countries to deploy a voluntary contact-tracing app, TraceTogether.\nBut only about 12% of the population installed it, and after a spike in new cases the city-state introduced a lockdown on 7 April, which it termed a \"circuit-breaker\".\nTo further complicate matters, a small number of phones still in use in the UK do not support the Bluetooth Low Energy system required, making the target even harder to reach.\nProf Fraser said that officials were discussing giving smartphones to those without - or cheaper, wearable Bluetooth devices - in order to boost the number of citizens involved.\nNHSX is also keen to keep the app opt-in.\nBut some have already started exploring the implications of it becoming obligatory.\nInternet law expert Prof Lillian Edwards has drafted a law to safeguard citizens' rights that says:\nOthers - including the cyber-security expert Ross Anderson and AI entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee - have cast doubt over whether contact-tracing apps have any chance of success, and fear they could give \"false hope\" to politicians looking for a way out of lockdowns.\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52296284": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52296284", "title": "Coronavirus: Shop workers should be trained to help abuse victims", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 17:20:36 GMT", "summary": "A code word system is needed to alert shop workers to those at risk during lockdown, Victims Commissioner says.", "story": "Supermarket workers should be trained to identify and help domestic abuse victims during the pandemic through a code word system, MPs have been told.\nDame Vera Baird, Victims Commissioner for England and Wales, said a scheme based on the Ask for Angela campaign to combat sexual violence was badly needed to help people during the lockdown.\nGoing shopping was one of few \"channels of escape\" for victims, she said.\nCalls to domestic abuse help lines have increased in the past three weeks.\nThe government has set aside an extra \u00a32m to support domestic abuse services while the Home Office has launched an initiative called 'You Are Not Alone' to help those experiencing domestic abuse.\nSpeaking at the government's daily coronavirus briefing, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said those at risk would get the \"right support\", adding \"there are so many costs to this awful epidemic and this is sadly one of them\". \nEarlier, Dame Vera told MPs on the Home Affairs Committee that the pandemic posed a unique challenge in terms of identifying and protecting vulnerable women and men. \nShe said there was evidence of a marked increase in killings of women by men, including by current or previous partners, since strict restrictions on people's movements were imposed on 23 March.\nShe said there had been, on average, five such deaths a week since then, much higher than the average of two a week over the equivalent period in previous years.\nShe said the figures - which were based on research by the Counting Dead Women project - showed the \"scale of the crisis\".\nThe police have said they have not, as yet, seen a spike in domestic violence crimes since the virus struck, while overall crime reported to police in England and Wales has dropped by around 20% in recent weeks.\nCharities believe that perpetrators will use the lockdown to further isolate their victims and stop them getting help.\nBut Dame Vera said supermarkets and pharmacies could be asked to play a role in helping those \"locked\" in their homes and only making occasional forays.\n\"You may be a very controlled person but the likelihood is that you are still being sent out to buy the food,\" she said.\nShe said if a victim was able to visit a supermarket she or he could use an agreed code word to discreetly ask for help, enabling a member of staff to alert either the police or a woman's refuge.  \nA similar system was introduced in bars and other venues in England in 2016, with anyone who feared they were in danger of being a victim of a sexual assault being encouraged to ask for 'Angela' as a sign they needed help. \nDame Vera urged ministers to talk to retailers about such a system, which she said was recently introduced in France.\nWhile many victims would not feel able to speak directly to a stranger, she said checkout staff and other workers would be able to respond quickly if they were prompted with a code word.\n\"We need to be flexible as people are locked in their homes and this is one channel of escape,\" she added.\nDame Vera also warned that women's refuges were largely full up and she appealed to ministers to do more to persuade hotel chains and universities to offer accommodation where available. \nAlso appearing before MPs, the Domestic Abuse Commissioner Nicole Jacobs said domestic violence and Covid-19 were a \"deadly combination\" and victims should be given more time to report abuse to the police. \nLabour's Yvette Cooper, who chairs the committee, said while it supported the government's effort to save lives by restricting movement, she said the reality was that many women were \"not safe\" in their homes.\nCampaigners welcomed last week's promise by government of \u00a3750m in emergency financial support for charities but said they were worried about how it would be \"fairly\" allocated.\nBaljit Banga, executive director of Imkaan, said many BAME organisations were not part of the current system of support administered by local authorities or police and crime commissioners.\n\"If it is mainly through existing frameworks then it will not get to BAME organisations.

Other changes to the way MPs work could be agreed informally between the Speaker and party leaders.\nOne of the trade unions which represents Parliamentary staff has said that Parliamentary scrutiny of the response to the current crisis is essential. \nGarry Graham, deputy general secretary of Prospect, said, \"Parliament can and should start meeting but any attempt to return to a full programme of business will be counterproductive and put employees and the effective functioning of the House at risk.\n\"Even if MPs are meeting virtually, staff will have to come into the House via public transport to facilitate that - those numbers must be kept to a minimum and where appropriate PPE must be provided.\n\"Using technology to conduct parliamentary business in this way has never been done - it has to work, and it has to be secure which will put a huge amount of pressure on staff.\"\nMembers of the National Assembly for Wales held their \nAssembly Members took part in their second plenary session using video-conferencing on Wednesday.  \nThe proceedings included statements on the latest response to coronavirus from the First Minister, Mark Drakeford, followed by a debate and vote on legislation.\nThe Assembly said that authorities for other global parliaments had contacted them to ask for advice on using the technology to hold their own virtual meetings.\nLeaders of the four opposition parties in Scotland put questions about coronavirus to First Minister Nicola Sturgeon via an online meeting for the first time on Thursday. \nPresiding Officer of the Scottish Parliament Ken Macintosh chaired the session from his regional constituency office.\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52293055": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52293055", "title": "HS2 construction gets green light despite lockdown", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 09:56:26 GMT", "summary": "The government has given the high-speed rail project formal approval to start construction.", "story": "The government has given formal approval for construction work on the HS2 rail project to begin despite lockdown measures.\nConstruction firms involved in phase one of the high-speed rail project will need to follow social distancing rules.\nHS2 minister Andrew Stephenson said: \"We cannot delay work on our long-term plan to level up the country.\"Prime Minister Boris Johnson approved the decision to build the rail link in February after a review into its cost.\nMatthew Kilcoyne, deputy director of the free-market Adam Smith Institute, called the government's announcement \"tone-deaf\" in the light of the coronavirus pandemic. \nMr Kilcoyne said: \"We've got an economic crisis that's going to cost taxpayers billions.

This will not cover people who were not put on the PAYE system until later in the month.  \nEmployers would need to have notified HM Revenue and Customs that a new employee was on the payroll. This is done through the Real Time Information (RTI) system which updates the tax authority when someone is paid.\nSo somebody paid late in March is unlikely to be covered by their current employer. \nHowever, the Treasury wants to guard against businesses hiring \"ghost\" employees to fraudulently claim furlough payments.\nThe plight of new starters has prompted a campaign for them to be included in the furlough scheme by unions, opposition parties, and the workers themselves.\nHMRC has promised to release wages for furloughed workers by the end of April. The scheme currently runs until 1 June.\nBut there are fears firms could start to cut staff unless the government soon clarifies whether the scheme will be extended. \nThe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said it is worried companies will be forced to start redundancy procedures this Saturday to comply with the minimum 45-day consultation period.\nCBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn, said: \"We are very concerned that businesses will be forced into a position potentially of having to make people permanently redundant.\"\nThe Treasury said the scheme, which pays wages for March, April and May, could run for longer.\n\"The scheme is open for an initial three months and we hope conditions will improve sufficiently during this period.

although they did not specify the number of deaths that had occurred.\nThe figures prompted the charity Age UK to claim coronavirus is \"running wild\" in care homes for elderly people.\n\"The current figures are airbrushing older people out like they don't matter,\" Caroline Abrahams, the charity's director, said.\nMeanwhile, Britain's largest care home operator, HC-One, said coronavirus was present in two-thirds - 232 - of the group's care homes.\nIts director, Sir David Behan, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that coronavirus deaths represented about one-third of all deaths at HC-One's care homes over the last three weeks. HC-One has 329 care homes throughout England, Scotland and Wales.\nMHA, a charity which operates 131 homes, said there had been 210 coronavirus-related deaths.About 410,000 people live in care homes in the UK, living in 11,300 care homes for older people supplied by 5,500 different providers.\nAddressing why deaths in care homes are not being included in the government's data, Ms Coffey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the figures published weekly by the ONS is a \"fair\" way of establishing the \"unfortunate picture\" of where deaths are occurring.\nEngland's care home regulator, the Care Quality Commission, has said it will begin recording deaths in adult social care from this week - asking care providers to give daily updates on the number of confirmed and suspected cases.\nLabour's shadow social care minister Liz Kendall said daily figures were essential to dealing with the \"emerging crisis\" in care homes and called for the government to offer social care \"whatever resources it needs\".\nConservative peer and former work and pensions minister Baroness Altmann told Today that \"one or two\" people in care homes had said to her they felt as though older people are being treated \"like lambs to the slaughter\".\n\"They [care homes] are left without protective equipment, they are left without testing,\" she said. \nShe added that \"the mark of a civilised society\" was \"how it treats it most vulnerable and oldest citizens\".\nIt comes after Ms Abrahams said care homes were \"underprepared\" for the outbreak, adding that the lack of personal protective equipment (PPE) and testing was leading to the spread of coronavirus across the care home sector. \nHowever, Ms Coffey told the Today programme that the care sector was not being left behind, adding that PPE was being delivered \"to over 26,000 care settings across the country including care homes, home care providers and also hospices\".\nOn Monday, the UK's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty told the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing that 92 homes in the UK reported outbreaks in one day.\nThe Department of Health and Social Care later confirmed 2,099 care homes in England have so far had cases of the virus.\nCare England has estimated there have been nearly 1,000 deaths from coronavirus in care homes, leaving social care as \"the neglected front line\".\nThe Labour Party has called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes to highlight the \"true scale\" of the spread of the virus, which causes the Covid-19 disease.\nThe issue has regularly been raised by journalists at the daily Downing Street briefing and the government response has been that the number announced each day is based on hospital figures as this can be quickly gathered and analysed - whereas deaths in the wider community take much longer to be collated after death certificates are issued by doctors.\nThe government says it is following the international standard by quoting the hospital figures each day - and that the fuller ONS figures can lag many days behind.\nThe latest care homes to confirm residents have died with symptoms of the virus include a home in Drumchapel, Glasgow, a specialist dementia home in Selston, Nottinghamshire, and a home in County Durham where 13 residents have died. \nThe Department of Health's official death number of deaths of people in hospital with coronavirus rose to 11,329 on Monday - up by 717 in a day.\nThe BBC's science editor David Shukman said the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) meeting later in the day will evaluate various ways coronavirus is unfolding in the UK.\nIt will look at hospital admissions, the approach to testing, data on intensive care capacity and deaths, the effectiveness of lockdown tactics, and whether or not the public should be advised to wear face masks outdoors.\nMeanwhile, the government has defended itself after reports it missed three chances to bulk-buy PPE for healthcare workers treating virus patients.\nHealth workers in 25 EU countries are set to receive deliveries of kit worth \u00a31.3bn in the coming days, according to the Guardian.The paper reports the UK missed three opportunities to join the scheme and has not taken part in talks on future purchases.\nThe Department of Health said it would \"consider participating in future EU joint procurement schemes on the basis of public health requirements at the time\".\n\"We will continue to work with European countries and others in order to make sure that we can increase the capacity within the NHS,\" they said.\nIn other developments:\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

They will feature at the COBR discussions. Indeed some senior public health experts believe that the government needs an economic counterpart to the influential SAGE committee of scientists. \nBut this isn't quite about a direct trade off. That existed clearly on the way in - the economy was shut down to protect public health. On the way out of these measures, the balance is not straightforward. \nIf the lockdown is lifted prematurely, the health system could fall over, workers might just refuse to go to work anyway, and none of that would be positive for the economy. \nIndeed when it is lifted, the absence of a vaccine means that these trade offs are likely to be considered week by week and sector by sector, for months to come.\nThe OBR expects UK debt to be higher for years to come, with extra borrowing expected to push Britain's debt share to above 100% of GDP this financial year if the lockdown lasts for three months.\nWhile this will drop sharply as the UK economy recovers, public debt is expected to remain at 84.9% of GDP in four years time, much higher than the 75.3% forecast in the March Budget.\nMr Chote said a longer lockdown could have more serious consequences for the economy.\nHe said: \"The longer the lockdown goes on, the more likely it is that the future potential of the economy is scarred by business failures, by less business investment and by the unemployed finding it harder to get back into the labour market.\"\nHowever, the OBR stressed that the restrictions were necessary to protect the economy from a more prolonged slowdown.\nIt said extra spending by the Treasury to support the economy would also limit the economic damage.\n\"The government's policy response will have substantial direct budgetary costs, but the measures should help limit the long-term damage to the economy and public finances - the costs of inaction would certainly have been higher,\" the OBR said.\nIt added that while the lockdown was the main constraint on economic activity, relaxing these measures too soon would cause greater damage. \n\"The reason why most of the short-term economic impact comes from these measures is that they are successful in limiting the spread of the disease.\n\"If the measures were not stringent enough to control the disease, then the economic impact from illness would be that much greater.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-52279578": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-52279578", "title": "Coronavirus: Suppliers 'not asked' to divert PPE to England", "published": "Tue, 14 Apr 2020 18:33:05 GMT", "summary": "UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock gives assurances to Scotland and the other devolved nations after a row about supplies.", "story": "Scotland's health secretary has received assurances that PPE suppliers were not asked to prioritise England over Scotland.\nJeane Freeman, along with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon, had expressed concern that care home workers north of the border could be losing out.\nMs Freeman later said she was grateful for the assurances given by the UK's health secretary.\nBut she also asked that any misunderstanding by firms be resolved. \nThe row developed as it was revealed another 40 people with Covid-19 had died in Scotland and the number of confirmed cases had risen by 291, to stand at 6,358.\nThe number of patients being treated in intensive care, however, has fallen by 15, to 196.\nAt Ms Sturgeon's daily briefing, she promised to seek urgent clarity on reports that Scottish care homes were being given a lower priority for supplies of personal protective equipment.\nClaims of PPE priority for England surfaced on Monday and came from Donald Macaskill, the head of Scottish Care, which is the body representing private care homes in Scotland.\nHe told BBC Radio Scotland the UK's four largest suppliers had said they were not sending to Scotland and instead prioritising \"England, the English NHS and then English social care providers\".\nUK Health Secretary Matt Hancock spoke to Ms Freeman and other health ministers from the different UK nations on Tuesday afternoon and insisted this was not the case.\nThe UK government said it had not instructed any company to prioritise PPE for one nation over the others.\nA spokesman added: \"Through this four nation approach, we're working closely with the devolved administrations to coordinate the distribution of PPE evenly across the UK.\"\nThe first minister acknowledged during her Tuesday briefing that there was no clear evidence PPE was being diverted, but she wanted to be given \"assurances\".\nMs Sturgeon insisted that if the usual supply of equipment to care homes in Scotland was being disrupted then that would be \"completely unacceptable\". \nShe told the media: \"All parts of the UK right now are facing supply challenges on PPE, indeed this is a global issue.\n\"Any situation where supplies were being diverted from one part of the UK to another without consultation or any sense of co-operation would clearly be unconscionable and unacceptable.\"\nIn a letter sent following her call with Matt Hancock, Scotland's health secretary said she was grateful for the reassurances.\nHowever, Jeane Freeman also highlighted one company - Gompels - which stated on its website that Public Health England restrictions meant it could not send supplies to Scotland and Wales. \nShe said this presented a \"contradiction and potential difficulty\" and asked Mr Hancock to resolve the matter - which she said could be the result of a misunderstanding - so that Gompels could continue to supply care homes in Scotland.\nThe suggestion of PPE being diverted to England from Scotland had earlier in the day been dismissed by the Scottish government's clinical director.\nProf Jason Leitch, speaking on the Good Morning Scotland programme, said: \"We have looked into it and we think it's rubbish. \n\"So the companies, and our colleagues at NHS England yesterday when we spoke to them, said it wasn't true.\n\"There's another element of this, though, that the English route for PPE is one of three routes that Scotland has access to PPE from.\n\"So we are in a four-country fight against this virus. Honestly, people might not believe me, but that four-countries' fight is pretty aligned.\"\nIn Scotland PPE comes from three sources;\nProf Leitch admitted there had been some issues in getting supplies distributed, in particular to those care homes that had not needed PPE in the past.\nHe added that the situation was being sorted \"very, very quickly\". \n\"I'm much more confident than I was even a week a go that that is now working,\" said the clinical director.\nA statement released by the Department of Health and Social Care on Monday said: \"PPE supplies are being coordinated at a

"Keir Starmer launches 'urgent' inquiry into anti-Semitism report", "published": "Tue, 14 Apr 2020 15:40:53 GMT", "summary": "The report says anti-Jeremy Corbyn sentiment at Labour HQ hindered efforts to tackle anti-Semitism.", "story": "Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer has launched an inquiry into the leak of an internal report into the party's handing of anti-Semitism claims.\nThe 860-page dossier says anti-Jeremy Corbyn sentiment among Labour staff hindered efforts to tackle the issue.\nSir Keir said the inquiry will look at why it was commissioned, its contents, and how it came into the public domain.\nThe Campaign Against Anti-Semitism said the report was leaked as an attempt to \"smear whistleblowers\".\nIt is understood the document - dated March 2020 - is a draft drawn up to help inform the party's responses to an investigation by the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC).\nThe watchdog launched a probe into anti-Semitism within Labour in May 2019 after a complaint from the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism. \nA Labour spokesman said the party had submitted \"extensive information to the EHRC and responded to questions and requests for further information\" - but none of that detail was included in the leaked report. \nIn a joint statement with deputy leader Angela Rayner, newly elected leader Sir Keir said: \"We have seen a copy of an apparently internal report about the work of the Labour Party's Governance and Legal Unit in relation to anti-Semitism.\n\"The content and the release of the report into the public domain raise a number of matters of serious concern.\n\"We will therefore commission an urgent independent investigation into this matter.\"\nHe said they have asked for \"immediate sight\" of any legal advice the Labour Party had received about the report.\n\"In the meantime, we ask everyone concerned to refrain from drawing conclusions before the investigation is complete and we will be asking the general secretary to put measures in place to protect the welfare of party members and party staff who are concerned or affected by this report,\" Sir Keir said.\nFor Jeremy Corbyn's enduring supporters, this report will back up what they've thought all along: that there were those in the party establishment who never accepted their man as leader.\nThe dismissive references to \"Trots\" and \"mentalists\" in WhatsApp messages, apparently between staff working for the party at the time, will clearly cause anger.\nHowever, it's the allegation that Labour staff worked \n a win for Mr Corbyn in the 2017 election that is likely to be most incendiary, if proven.\nExplosive as all this may be, some have questioned how much bearing it has on what the report says it's about: the handling of anti-Semitism disciplinary cases.\nSo, Sir Keir Starmer has promised an investigation, not just into the content, but into how the document came into being and got into the public domain (and, with it, unredacted  information about some members).\nIt seems like a signal that he won't favour any one faction but it also suggests that his stated aim of uniting the party will be far from easy.\nFor Sir Keir, the timing of this latest very public row could not be worse, as he tries to focus on his party's response to the coronavirus epidemic.\nShadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said she \"wasn't aware of this report until it was leaked\" and that the party needed to understand the circumstances under which it was leaked, because it contained sensitive information.\n\"We also need to look at the cultures that appear to have been described in that report and that needs a proper independent review, that is going to be delivered, and I think that will answer any questions that people have,\" she said.\nThe leaked document said Labour's latest investigation into anti-Semitism in the party revealed \"a litany of mistakes, deficiencies, and missed opportunities to reform, develop and adapt a clearly failing disciplinary system\", and \"disproved any suggestion that anti-Semitism is not a problem in the party\".\nIt also said the \"rigorous and far-reaching reforms necessary to bring the party's procedures up to standard were not undertaken early enough\".\nHowever, the document claimed the \"extremely strained relationship\" between Mr Corbyn and Labour headquarters during his tenure had stopped oversight \"over the disciplinary process\", with the party's management being \"generally more obstructive than it was constructive\".\nIt included transcripts of WhatsApp messages between party staff, which it said showed opposition to Mr Corbyn.\nAt the extreme, some staff members seemed to have \"taken a view that the worse things got for Labour, the happier they would be since this might expedite Jeremy Corbyn's departure from office,\" the report said.\nIt claimed to have found \"no evidence\" of anti-Semitism complaints being handled differently to other forms of complaint, and said that in 2019, half of all anti-Semitism complaints came from a \"one individual\" who is accused of being \"rude and abusive\" to party staff.\nThe report also claimed there had been a \"steady, if imperfect, rate of improvement\" after Mr Corbyn's ally, Jennie Formby, took over as general secretary from the former post holder, Ian McNicol. \nThe document praised measures taken by Mr Corbyn since 2018, including the introduction of fast track expulsions, describing the moves as \"transformational\".\nIt added: \"These safeguards ensure that the past mistakes in the handling of anti-Semitism complaints cannot be repeated now.\"\nBut the Campaign Against Anti-Semitism, which reported Labour to the EHRC, said the report \"serves as an exhibit of the party's failure to address the crisis\" and should be handed over to the watchdog. \nThe organisation's chief executive, Gideon Falter, said: \"In the dying days of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, the Labour Party appears to have invested in a desperate last-ditch attempt to deflect and discredit allegations of anti-Semitism.\n\"Rather than properly dealing with cases of anti-Semitism and the culture of anti-Jewish racism that prevailed during Mr Corbyn's tenure, the party has instead busied itself trawling through 10,000 of its own officials' e-mails and WhatsApp messages in an attempt to imagine a vast anti-Corbyn conspiracy and to continue its effort to smear whistleblowers.\"\nLabour has been plagued with allegations of anti-Semitism since 2016.\nMr Corbyn held an internal investigation early on in his tenure, but it was widely criticised by Jewish members of the party, with a number - including MPs - leaving over his handling of the row.\nThe party's new leader, Sir Keir Starmer, has apologised to the Jewish community for the ongoing issue.\nHe has been praised by leaders for \nthan Mr Corbyn did \"in four years\" on tackling anti-Semitism.\n\"achieving more in four days\" \n", "pic":

supported such a move.", "story": "The government does not expect to make changes to coronavirus lockdown restrictions this week, Dominic Raab has said.\nThe foreign secretary said the UK's plan \"is working\" but that \"we are still not past the peak of this virus\".\n\"Keep this up, we have come too far, lost too many loved ones and sacrificed too much to ease up,\" he said.\nIt came as the government said it might change its advice to the public on wearing face masks outdoors.\nThe UK's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the daily Downing Street news conference the guidance was subject to an ongoing review.\nHe added that the government had already seen \"more persuasive\" data suggesting masks can stop a person passing the virus to someone else, rather than preventing them from catching it.The World Health Organization said it remains the case that medical masks should be reserved for healthcare workers, not the general public.\nMr Raab - who is standing in for Prime Minister Boris Johnson as he recovers from coronavirus - said a meeting of scientific advisers would take place to review evidence relating to the current lockdown restrictions this week.\n\"We don't expect to make any changes to the measures currently in place at that point and we won't until we're confident, as confident as we realistically can be, that any such changes can be safely made,\" he said.\nHe told the news conference that easing restrictions too early would \"risk a second wave\" of infections.\nResponding to claims the government lacks an exit strategy, Mr Raab said it was \"crucially important that we do not take our eye off the ball or the public's focus\" off social distancing measures.\nHe admitted the government had been \"concerned\" people \"might start ignoring the advice or cutting corners given the temptation to go out into the sunshine\" over the Easter weekend. However, he said the \"overwhelming\" majority of people stayed at home. \nSpeaking on ITV's Coronavirus Q&A programme, Sir Patrick Vallance said of the lockdown: \"It is important that we continue it long enough and that we do not just say 'victory - remove it immediately in totality'.\n\"The next phase of this is understanding how and when to release these measures in a way that is safe.\"\nThe number of deaths in UK hospitals has risen to 11,329 - up by 717 since Sunday.\nThe Department of Health said a further 4,342 people had tested positive for coronavirus as of 09:00 BST on Monday.\nIt has become a vexed issue in this pandemic and the UK government's chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, said the country's stance was being reviewed.\nSo far the UK has advised against the use of face masks by the general public. \nThere remains concern that wearing one gives people a false sense of security leading to them slacking off other measures such as hand washing.\nBut the United States changed its mind and recommends that even healthy people do wear them.\nThat shift was in part due to the science showing people were infectious for a day before they start showing symptoms. \nThe World Health Organization's special envoy on coronavirus, Dr David Nabarro, said he thought wearing face masks would become the \"norm\".\nHe said the priority was health care workers and then for people who have the disease to minimise their risk of spreading it. \nBut in the future he can see face masks being recommended for people who can't socially distance in their jobs, such as hairdressers, and then eventually everyone.\nProf Chris Whitty, the UK government's chief medical adviser, told the briefing that 92 care homes had detected an outbreak of coronavirus in the last day alone.\n\"If an outbreak is suspected public health authorities will go in to do testing to check if an outbreak has taken place,\" he said.\nThe Department of Health later confirmed to the BBC that coronavirus outbreaks have been detected at 2,099 facilities in England so far. \nProf Whitty added that he would like to have \"much more extensive testing\" in care homes due to the \"large numbers of vulnerable people\" there. \n\"One of the things we want to do is to extend the amount of testing of people in care homes as the ability to test ramps up over the next few weeks,\" he said. \nLiz Kendall, Labour's shadow minister for social care, called on the government to publish daily figures of deaths in care homes \"so we know the true scale of the problem and how fast it is spreading\".\nIt came as 13 residents of one 72-bed care home in County Durham were confirmed to have died after displaying symptoms of coronavirus.\nMeanwhile, Sir Patrick warned the number of deaths recorded in the UK is likely to rise in the coming days before they could plateau.\nHe said: \"I think this week we are going to see a further increase, thereafter we should see a plateau as the effects of social-distancing come through. That plateau may last for some time and begin to decrease.\"\nIn other developments:\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

On this count Belgium seems to be heading for a serious problem like Italy and Spain,\" he said. \nThere have been so many grim milestones in this coronavirus outbreak but passing a death toll of 10,000 may prove one of the most shocking. \nThere are positive signs that the rate of infection is slowing, driven down by social distancing. \nBut the numbers dying every day may increase still further because some people who caught the virus three or four weeks ago may not survive intensive care now. \nThe scientists advising the government have long warned of this lag between measures to keep the public at home and a reduction in the daily death toll. \nThe expectation is that on current trends there will be a peak, perhaps in a week or two, though no-one can predict how long it'll take after that for the losses to fall to low levels. \nIt all depends on the public's response and so far officials say it's been overwhelmingly supportive.   \nOn Saturday evening Mr Johnson paid tribute to the medics treating him, saying: \"I can't thank them enough.

But doctors and nurses have continued to report shortages. \nCare homes, pharmacies, GP practices and community health teams feel they are at the back of the queue for equipment to protect staff who may come into contact with patients who have Covid-19. \nThere has also been confusion over how safety guidelines should apply. \nNow Matt Hancock has admitted there are global supply problems and says it is a \"herculean effort\" to get deliveries to health workers and a \"huge task\" to keep it going.

By mid-April, 21,000 tests were being conducted a day, on 14,000 people.\nSo what are the tests and why has it been difficult to scale them up?\nThe tests currently being used in UK hospitals are to see if somebody currently has Covid-19.\nThey are being carried out in hospitals and at 29 drive-through testing centres across the country.\nThese are done by taking a swab of the nose or throat, which is sent off to a lab to look for signs of the virus's genetic material.\nThe other type of test the government wants to use is an antibody test. These are done to see if someone has already had the virus.\nThey work by looking for signs of immunity, by using a drop of blood on a device, a bit like a pregnancy test. \nThe government bought three-and-a-half million antibody tests, but has not yet found one that is reliable enough to use.\nThe UK did not start with the resources to do mass testing, unlike some other countries. \nHealth Secretary Matt Hancock said: \"We have the best scientific labs in the world but we did not have the scale.  My German counterpart for instance could call upon 100 testing labs ready and waiting when the crisis struck.\"\nThe UK government also took a different approach at the beginning of the crisis, using a smaller number of labs and keeping more control centrally. \nThere have been suggestions it did not act quickly enough, as countries like Germany and South Korea - which have been able to test far more widely than the UK has - rapidly stockpiled kits and made the test available to a larger number of labs. \nAt first, Public Health England was only using its own eight laboratories, later expanding to a further 40 NHS labs. It was only at the end of March that the government said it would work to recruit more laboratories from universities, research institutes and private companies. \nAs well as lab space and people to do the swabs, UK testing efforts have been held back by challenges in getting hold of swabs, testing kits and reagents.\nA reagent is the substance used to extract the virus's genetic material so it can be studied more easily. At the moment there is high global demand for reagents, which is why they are hard to obtain. \nThe government is trying to ease this shortage by involving pharmaceutical companies GlaxoSmithKline and Astrazeneca in producing reagents in the UK.\nThere are two main reasons for testing people - to diagnose them individually, and to work out how far the virus has spread. \nHaving this second piece of information could help the health service plan for extra demand, including on intensive care units. \nTesting could also inform decisions around social distancing measures. For example, if large numbers of people were found to have already been infected, then a lockdown might become less necessary. \nAnd not testing more widely means many people might be self-isolating for no reason, including NHS workers.\nTesting is not yet available for most people.\nAt the moment, tests are reserved for seriously ill patients in hospital and for certain key workers.\nTests had previously been available for health and social care workers who have coronavirus symptoms, or who live in a household with someone who does.\nThe eligibility has now been expanded beyond health and care workers to include the police, the fire service, prison officers, judges and some local government staff. Workers responsible for administering benefits can also get tests.  \nThis means that if even if you develop symptoms, but you don't work in one of those roles, then you can't currently find out if you have coronavirus.\nIf you do work in one of those roles and you develop symptoms, then the government's advice is that you should \"let your employer know you're isolating\" and they should \"confirm if you're eligible and help you get a test appointment\".\nThe Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said that there is currently extra \"capacity\" in the system, particularly at the drive-through testing centres, but that there hasn't been \"enough demand\".\nBut this has been challenged by some of the bodies representing key workers, who have said that a major issue is the accessibility of those centres.\nDame Donna Kinnair, from the Royal College of Nursing, said: \"What I'm hearing from the frontline is nurses are sometimes driving two hours, feeling very unwell with possible symptoms of coronavirus and driving to a testing station.\"\nMatt Wrack, from the Fire Brigades Union, responded directly to the suggestion from Mr Hancock that the problem has been a lack of \"demand\" for tests, saying: \"This is surely an issue of accessibility, rather than frontline staff not wanting to be tested. Many of the testing centres are far out of town and require extended trips in a car.\"\nThe diagnostic tests used in hospitals are very reliable. \nHowever, that doesn't mean they will pick up every case of coronavirus.

A study of one village in Italy suggests 50-75% of Covid-19 cases there could be asymptomatic.\nContainment phase\nThe first part of the UK's strategy to deal with coronavirus involved trying to catch cases early and trace anyone who had been in close contact\nCoronavirus\nA generic name for a group of viruses which cause illness and disease in humans and animals. The disease caused can be severe or mild. The common cold and influenza (flu) are examples of coronaviruses.\nCovid-19\nCovid-19 is the name of the specific disease caused by the type of coronavirus first detected in Wuhan in China in late 2019. It primarily affects the lungs.\nDelay phase\nThe second part of the UK strategy to deal with coronavirus involves delaying its spread by introducing 'social distancing' where people avoid close contact with others by working from home, avoiding public transport and restricting major events.\nFlatten the curve\nDescribes measures to prevent a very high number of cases of disease occurring at the same time and potentially overloading health services. By slowing transmission rates through measures like social distancing, cases take place over a longer period of time and hospitals remain within capacity - the 'peak' of cases is flattened into a smoother curve on a chart.\nFlu\nFlu is a virus which routinely causes disease in humans and animals. There are two main types or strains of flu, A and B. These are responsible for seasonal flu epidemics.\nHerd immunity\nDescribes how the spread of a disease can be limited by a certain number of people (or animals) being exposed to it and acquiring immunity, therefore slowing its spread.\nImmune\nA person whose body can withstand or fend off disease is said to be immune to that disease. Once a person has recovered from Covid-19, they are thought to have some immunity to the disease - that is, they cannot get it again - for a certain period of time. However how long immunity lasts is not known, and there have been some reports of people testing positive for a second time.\nIncubation period\nThe period of time between catching a disease and the body starting to display symptoms.\nLockdown\nAny restriction on movement or daily life, where public buildings are closed and people urged to remain at home behind closed doors. Lockdowns have been imposed in several countries as part of drastic efforts to control the spread of disease.\nMitigation phase\nThe fourth part of the UK's strategy to deal with coronavirus involves mitigating the impact of a high number of case on public services. This could mean the NHS stopping all non-critical care and police only responding to major crimes and emergencies.\nNHS 111\nThe NHS's 24-hour phone line which offers medical advice to anyone who rings it. Anyone who suspects they may have coronavirus symptoms is asked to call NHS 111 rather than attend a GP surgery or hospital A&E.\nOutbreak\nMultiple cases of a disease occuring rapidly, either in a cluster or in multiple locations, is known as an outbreak.\nPandemic\nAn epidemic of serious disease spreading rapidly in several countries simultaneously is known as a pandemic.\nQuarantine\nMeans the isolation of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease to prevent it spreading to others.\nSars\nSars or SARS refers to Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, a type of coronavirus which emerged in Asia in 2003.\nSelf-isolation\nMeans staying inside and avoiding all contact with other people with the aim of preventing any possible spread of disease.\nSocial distancing\nTaking measures to avoid coming into direct contact with others. This can mean avoiding any social gatherings, and in daily life, keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from other people.\nState of emergency\nUsually refers to measures taken by a government to restrict daily life while it deals with a crisis. This can involve closing schools and workplaces, restricting the movement of people and even possibly deploying the armed forces to support regular emergency services.\nSymptoms\nSymptoms are any outward physical sign of disease, such as a cough, sore throat or fever. They are triggered by the body's immune system as it attempts to fight off the infection.\nVaccine\nA substance which causes the body to produce antibodies, which fight off a disease, and gives immunity against further infection.\nVirus\nA tiny agent which replicates inside the living cells of any organism. Viruses can cause these cells to die and interupt the body's normal chemical processes, causing disease.\nWhat do all these terms mean?\nThe disease\u00a0caused by\u00a0the coronavirus\u00a0first detected in Wuhan, China,\u00a0in late 2019.

Pubs, restaurants, theatres, cinemas and places of worship have all also shut. These restrictions have affected all aspects of society.\nThe lockdown's aim has been to limit the spread of coronavirus across the country, to help the NHS to cope and ultimately reduce the number of deaths from the disease.\nSince the lockdown started on 23 March, the number of people who have tested positive for coronavirus has gone from 6,650 to more than 80,000. \nBut the government's advisers have said there is evidence that the public's adherence to the measures is starting to have an impact.\nSir Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, said: \"It's not taking off in that sharp uptake, it's not gone sky high. And if anything there might even be some flattening. That is because of what we're all doing with social distancing.\"\nPeople are also adapting to how they use the health service.\nIn March, the number of people attending A&E dropped whilst the numbers of calls made to 111 - the NHS's hotline - reached record highs. \nThe public's use of transport has fallen dramatically over the past few weeks, although this trend started before the lockdown measures were announced by the prime minister, as many people started to work from home.\nOverall transport use - across road, rail and the Tube in London - fell by 60% between early February and the beginning of April, the Department for Transport says.\nFootfall at major railway stations across the country has also fallen significantly since the lockdown was introduced, data from Network Rail suggests.\nFor example, in the week before the measures were brought in, footfall at Birmingham New Street station stood at over half a million. But that had fallen by 86% at the start of April to just 71,230. It's a similar trend for London and Manchester.\nMeanwhile, trips to parks and beaches on 5 April, the second Sunday of lockdown, were 29% lower than normal according to Google analytics data.

Have friends round? Have a night out? A holiday? Or even go back to work? When can children go back to school?\nLockdowns have been essential for containing the spread of coronavirus, but they are causing huge disruption, and distress, to lives around the world. \nSo when can they be lifted? \nThere are big decisions for governments to make - when to act, which restrictions to lift, how to contain the virus instead and how to balance saving lives today with long-term damage to society. \nThis is going to be a long journey - don't think it will all be over in a few weeks. \n\"Essentially we've got a lot of not very good options, it won't be one day and everything will change, but things could open up,\" Dr Adam Kucharski, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC.\nWe cannot simply return to normal after cases peak or even after they are reduced to very low levels. \nThe best estimate of the proportion of people infected (and potentially immune) in the UK is just 4%. Or to put that another way - more than 63 million are still vulnerable to the infection. \nIf we just lift the lockdown, then another explosive outbreak is inevitable. \nThe fundamentals of the virus have not changed either - one person infected will, without a lockdown, pass it onto three others on average.\nCutting those infections by 60-70% is what it takes to keep cases down. At the moment that means cutting our human contact by that amount.\nIf we lift social distancing measures then something else has to come in to suppress the virus instead or at least to prevent people ending up in intensive care. \nThere may be some easy wins if countries are already cutting infections by more than 70%.\n\"There is evidence that a lot of countries in lockdown have gone beyond that, in China it is 80-90%,\" said Dr Kucharski.\nA high number now is good for bringing cases down quickly.\nBut it is also an opportunity to lift some of the current restrictions without leading to a spike in cases.\nChina, particularly in the original epicentre of the pandemic - Wuhan, had a tough and lengthy lockdown that including shutting down public transport. It is not yet clear how much wiggle room other countries may or may not have. \nMassively increasing testing for the virus allows for a strategy called \"seek and destroy\". \nYou identify cases. Test anybody they came into contact with. And isolate them before they become infectious. \nIt is remarkably similar to the approach taken at the start of the outbreak when there were relatively few imported cases being hunted down. \nDo this successfully enough and it will reduce the ability of the virus to spread and will mean we do not need as tough a set of restrictions on day-to-day life. \n\"At the moment you need, on average, a 60-70% reduction in social interactions to stop the outbreak increasing,\" said Dr Kucharski. \n\"If we can get that down to 30% that gives you a lot more to play with.\"\nBut even massive testing is not life as normal. \nYou would need other measures to keep the disease in check and these would have to be maintained in the long-term as the fundamentals (a virus that spreads and a vulnerable population) would not change. \n\"It is a more moderate version of where we are now,\" said Dr Kucharski. \nIt is also intensive work that has to be done quickly in order to stay ahead of the infection (this is where talk of a smartphone app comes in to identify cases) and the method is most viable when cases are at low levels. \nAnother strategy is called \"enhanced shielding\". \nInstead of trying to suppress the coronavirus across every section of society you could instead aim to stop it completely for those most at risk.\nAge and other medical conditions greatly increase the risk of Covid-19 becoming fatal. \nThe lockdown is preventing intensive care units being overwhelmed, but guaranteeing vulnerable groups don't get infected could achieve the same aim even if cases were spreading more widely in the young and the healthy.\nProf Mark Woolhouse, from the University of Edinburgh, said: \"Very crudely, for 80% of us who are not vulnerable this is a nasty virus, it's certainly a significant health problem, but it wouldn't overwhelm the healthcare system and it wouldn't lock down society. \n\"If we really bolster that shielding, make a very strong shield indeed, then it buys you a lot more room and it may mean you can relax some measures permanently.\"\nWe are already Analysis: How do we get out of lockdown? and asking them to stay at home for 12 weeks. \nEnhancing that could mean all staff in hospitals, care homes or anyone visiting the elderly having regular testing to ensure they are clear of the virus. Ideally antibody tests would prove they are immune to it. \nThe danger is, having more virus circulating in the community could be harder to control and then those \"shields\" will come under intense pressure. \nSome restrictions have less of an effect on the virus than others. \n\"There are certain interactions and activities that are overall less risky,\" said Dr Kucharski.\nHe argues lifting different restrictions can be put into three broad categories - those with low, moderate and substantial risk of increasing transmission of the virus. \nLow risk includes exercising outdoors, which has been restricted in some countries. \nModerate would include letting some non-essential shops re-open or having occasional gatherings with people outside the household. \nSubstantial increases could come from lifting advice to work from home, reopening schools or isolating sick people and quarantining households.\n\"I think the order things went in will be reflected in the order things will be lifted,\" he says.\nBut which measures to lift will be a difficult balancing act. It will have to be a combination of the benefits to society and the economy against the impact on the spread of the virus. \nProf Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, said: \"We do want to find a collection of policies that maintain suppression of this virus.\n\"Without doubt, measures will be targeted probably by age, by geography and we will need to introduce in my view larger levels of testing at the community level to really isolate cases more effectively and identify where transmission is happening.\"\nThe idea of immunity passports or certificates is constantly doing the rounds - if you've had the disease you have a test and if you have antibodies that can kill the virus then you can go about your daily life.\nHowever, there are a number of scientific challenges. \nWe don't have an accurate antibody test. We don't know how long immunity might last. And we don't know that even if antibodies stop you from becoming ill whether they are enough to stop you harbouring the virus and spreading it to others. \nProf Ferguson has suggested measures could begin to be lifted by the end of May.\nBut there is also a decision about how far we go with suppressing the virus after we've gone past the peak. \nWe could drive levels down as low as possible and that will greatly limit the ability of the virus to bounce back in a second wave. But the trade off is maintaining the lockdown for longer. \nOr we could exit lockdown earlier and accept having a higher number of cases bubbling away, which creates its own problems. \nThere is also a decision over whether to maintain a UK-wide approach to lifting lockdown or whether measures could vary regionally, or even within cities, to focus on where outbreaks are happening. \nThe biggest thing that could come along is a vaccine - if people were immunised then there would be no need for any social distancing measures. That is thought to be more than a year away.\nIf a vaccine does not come along (people are hopeful, but it is requiring development at unprecedented speed) then the concept of herd immunity may kick in. \nThis would happen when so many people had been infected (up to 70% of the population) that the virus can no longer cause large outbreaks. \nEffective drugs would also make a huge difference. If they could stop Covid-19 from progressing from a cough or fever into a serious disease needing intensive care then having large numbers of cases would be less of a problem. Again we are waiting for the results of clinical trials.\nWe might get closer to normality, or at least normality for some, in the months to come. But we are all still in this for the long haul. \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52193461": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52193461", "title": "Coronavirus: Who\u2019s in charge if the PM is ill?", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 09:12:42 GMT", "summary": "Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab is deputising for Boris Johnson while he recovers from coronavirus.", "story": " Foreign Secretary \n said he had \"all the authority\" he needed to make relevant decisions, as he deputised for Boris Johnson while he was in hospital with coronavirus. \nThe prime minister, \n, is now recovering at Chequers, and is not expected to return to work for some time. \nSo who else shares power and how are decisions made while the prime minister is ill?\nMr Raab is the foreign secretary, but he also has the title of \n - giving him seniority above all other cabinet ministers. \nSo if Mr Johnson did not return to his post, Mr Raab would take over in the first instance.\nWhen Mr Johnson was moved into intensive care, Mr Raab said the government would continue to focus \"at the prime minister's direction\" on defeating coronavirus.\nThe role of deputy prime minister - like that of first secretary of state - is not a permanent position in government.

It's an episode, D'Angour argues, that holds many lessons for today.\nBritain's Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, is well versed in the history and culture of ancient Greece. He knows that Western literature begins with a plague, the epidemic described in the opening book of Homer's Iliad - of which Boris can happily declaim scores of verses from memory. And his political hero has long been the ancient Athenian leader, Pericles, whose bust sits in his office in 10 Downing Street.\nThe prime minister has often quoted admiringly the stirring oration given by Pericles to honour the dead after the first year of a destructive war against Sparta. And he will be well aware that Pericles gave a second famous speech a year later, after a devastating plague, probably a form of typhus, had killed around one third of Athens' citizens.\nBoth orations were reported by the contemporary historian Thucydides, whose searing description of the Great Plague is worth reading for its literary virtuosity alone. Commentators today have drawn parallels between the responses of Athenians - ranging from the heroic to the contemptible - and those of valiant NHS staff and scared panic-buyers today. \nBut surprisingly, none has drawn attention to the lesson Thucydides himself intended. What doesn't change, wrote the historian, is human nature; you can expect people to react in similar ways when they encounter events like those that have occurred in the past. He embarked on his work, he says, because a clear grasp of the events he was living through could guide responses to similar events in future.\nHe modelled his method on that of the most innovative medical practitioner of the day, the physician Hippocrates. Rather than prescribing prayers and religious rituals, spells and incantations, or exotic herbs and quack remedies, Hippocrates and his contemporaries were visiting sick patients, meticulously noting their symptoms, and keeping track of how they responded to prescribed treatments such as sleep, exercise, and the regulation of diet. Boris Johnson was a patient at St Thomas' hospital, and is likely to have been participating in a medical trial that compares treatments for Covid-19 - so it may be that Hippocrates will come to his mind, as well as Pericles and Thucydides.\n\"One of the worst aspects of the plague was the despair into which people fell on finding they had the disease. Those who were convinced they had no hope were much quicker to give up and die,\" observed Thucydides. \"Another was the rate of infection among those who flocked to care for and doctor to others: they died in droves, and had the highest incidence of mortality\u2026 In addition, the plague led to greater crime, since criminals calculated on escaping detection and penalties.\"\nWhat might we learn from these observations? First, that people should avoid becoming infected by close contact, and that medical staff and carers should be protected. Secondly, that the law must continue to function robustly. And thirdly, that it is important for people to preserve a positive state of mind. Measures to achieve these aims have been, if in some cases belatedly, widely pursued in the UK and elsewhere.\nThe Athenians survived the plague of 430 BC with astonishing resilience. Just 15 years later they were able to muster a huge military and naval force to mount an offensive expedition overseas. But when the plague struck, Athens had only recently gone to war, and a large contingent of troops had been sent north to pursue hostilities. Sadly, they took the disease with them, and over 1,000 men died from it.\nOne of the soldiers serving on the campaign was the philosopher, Socrates. Not only did he survive infection, allegedly thanks to his physical toughness and discipline, but on return to his plague-ridden city he was said to have tended unscathed to the sick and dying. Socrates had evidently acquired immunity from his earlier exposure to the disease, just as Thucydides himself, who had survived infection, recognised that this made him immune from reinfection.\nIt was to be thousands of years before medical immunity was properly understood, but the historian implies that historical hindsight can itself be a kind of vaccine. History need not simply recall the horrors of the past. It can guide us towards adopting precautions, remind us that accurate observation is vital to ensure a better response in future, and reassure us that normal life will one day return.\nMeanwhile, we should also remember that history never repeats itself exactly, even if it can offer valuable lessons for posterity. \nPericles had been the leading citizen in Athens for over three decades before his death from the plague at the age of 66. Until that day his luck had held to a remarkable degree. He had been admired and bitterly reviled, had fought military campaigns and faced legal trials, and had survived accusations of corruption and sexual misconduct. In his 50s he entered into a passionate and enduring relationship with the brilliant young Aspasia of Miletus, who bore him a child and helped him compose his magnificent funeral oration to the war dead.\nBritain's prime minister is 55.

In November 2018, he quit, criticising her position on Brexit.\nHe argued that he could not \"in good conscience\" support the \"backstop\" arrangement designed to avoid a hard border between the Irish Republic and Northern Ireland.\nAs an influential Brexiteer, his comments were seen as significant in increasing opposition to Mrs May's withdrawal agreement with the EU, which MPs repeatedly rejected.\nAfter Mrs May announced she was standing down last year, Mr Raab entered the contest to become Conservative leader, and prime minister.\nIn a crowded field, he failed to get the 33 MPs' votes he needed to progress to the third round. Fellow Brexiteers Boris Johnson and Michael Gove outlasted him.\nMark Francois, one of the most strongly pro-Brexit of Tory MPs, said: \"Whoever wins, and I hope it's Boris, I hope they find a good place for Dom in their cabinet, because I think he deserves it.\"\nMr Johnson, \n after his elimination from the the race, did just that. On 24 July last year he became foreign secretary and first secretary of state - effectively deputy prime minister.\nThe new job gave him an international profile surpassed only by Mr Johnson's, in terms of the UK government.\nBut he only narrowly managed to hold on to Esher and Walton at last December's general election, seeing off a strong Liberal Democrat challenged by 2,743 votes.\nThe overall Conservative landslide, however, on a promise to \"get Brexit done\", meant he saw his dream of leaving the EU come true on 31 January this year.\nSince then coronavirus has taken over from Brexit as the UK government's number one priority, although tough negotiations on a trade deal with Brussels are continuing, via video link.\nNow Mr Raab, as well as being first secretary of state, has effectively taken over running the country as Mr Johnson is being treated in hospital for coronavirus.\nto whom Mr Raab gave his support\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52108350": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-52108350", "title": "Five challenges for new Labour leader", "published": "Sat, 04 Apr 2020 12:50:31 GMT", "summary": "Sir Keir Starmer has a daunting in-tray as he takes over from Jeremy Corbyn at Labour's helm.", "story": "Even before the coronavirus emergency, the next Labour leader was facing a formidable set of challenges. \nHere is what is likely to be at the top of Sir Keir Starmer's in-tray.\nIn February, Sir Keir Starmer said that if he won the Labour leadership he would use the Commons to attack Boris Johnson as \"a prime minister with no conviction or principles\". \nBut that was before the coronavirus pandemic changed everything.\nNow, in the midst of an unprecedented national emergency, with MPs working from home, and the prime minister in isolation, that is not really an option. He will need to find a way of holding the government to account - and asking tough questions - without getting personal or appearing to score political points.\nHe set the tone in his victory message, saying: \"Under my leadership we will engage constructively with the government, not opposition for opposition's sake. \n\"Not scoring party political points or making impossible demands.

I have seen the grief that it has brought to so many Jewish communities.

And yet many are stranded. \nAirports have been closed and borders shut. Cities have been placed in lockdown. Many are trapped in hotels, often with money and food running out. \nThey are sitting on the phone calling airlines or tour operators, on hold for hours or failing to get through at all. They are emailing, phoning and messaging the local British embassy, often to no avail. \nIn hundreds of posts and videos on social media, they are voicing their frustration from all corners of the world and asking - why is more not being done to help them? \nWell, here's why. \nNo-one knows how many Britons are travelling abroad at any one time. The UK is not a police state and does not require its citizens to register every time they leave. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told MPs recently it could be anything between 300,000 and a million people at any one time. \nThese travellers are not on any list and are dispersed to the four winds. Many are not in capital cities but confined instead by local curfews in provincial towns. Some will be in places that are within easy reach. Others will be in locations where there are no direct flights to the UK even in normal times. \nGetting such numbers home is an unprecedented, historic task and will not be solved by asking British Airways to arrange a few flights. \nThe FCO is largely a diplomatic machine, designed to develop and implement foreign policy and promote British interests overseas. It has a consular arm, of course, to help Britons in trouble overseas but it is not designed to deal with something of this scale. \nThe crisis centre in the bowels of King Charles Street was set up in 2012 so the FCO could handle two incidents in different places at the same time, such as an earthquake and a tsunami. It was not designed to handle a global consular crisis with many thousands of Britons simultaneously stranded round the world. \nTo give you a sense of context, according to the latest FCO accounts, in 2018/19, the department helped more than 22,000 British people in new consular cases around the world, and ongoing support to 7,700 existing cases. They are now having to cope with hundreds of thousands at the same time. \nSo as a result the FCO is having to reconfigure itself in the midst of the crisis. Whole departments have been closed down and staff redeployed to help handle the crisis. \nAfter the 2017 hurricanes, the FCO trained 20% of its staff - about 550 people - to be able to respond to crises. Now almost the whole of the FCO is being retasked. \nThe Foreign Office is spread very thinly. It has 280 posts in 168 countries and 10 overseas territories. But it has only about 2,000 actual diplomats in positions abroad. They are supported by locally hired staff in each country. But the numbers vary. \nAnd some embassies or high commissions can be much smaller than you might imagine. They can take some calls but might not have enough people to absorb hundreds or thousands of people phoning in. \nThe Foreign Office has suffered spending cuts for years and one of its biggest costs are staff salaries. William Hague famously noted, when foreign secretary, that the FCO had a smaller budget than Kent County Council. \nIf you ring up an embassy and you cannot get through, or it is a weekend, you will almost certainly be put through to the FCO's central consular contact centres. \nThese are located, perhaps surprisingly, in Malaga and Ottawa. They were set up in 2011 to help handle basic queries so embassies and high commissions could focus on more important cases. \nIn the whole of the financial year 2018/19, these two call centres received 350,000 calls. The vast majority were sorted out without having to contact the relevant embassy for a reply. \nIn contrast, on one day recently, Malaga handled 28,000 calls alone. As a result the FCO has in recent days tripled the capacity of its call centres.\nGovernments have closed their airports for a reason. They are petrified that coronavirus might spread. They know that if they make an exception for the UK, then many other countries will demand an exception too. \nSo British diplomats are having to call in favours to try to persuade counterparts to lift the lockdown temporarily. The Foreign Secretary has spoken to more than 30 other foreign ministers in recent days trying to get them to open up their airspace. \nDeals are being done. Some countries are helping each other bring their nationals back, trading seats on flights. But this diplomacy is hard and it takes time. \nAs well as talking to ministers and officials, British diplomats are also having to negotiate with military chiefs who are often in charge of national airports. \nOnce the UK has persuaded a country to open its airports, it then has to persuade the airlines to put on some commercial flights. This is easier said than done. \nAirlines are businesses and they have to be convinced and paid to put on flights. That means they need a clear sense of passenger numbers and that can be hard to confirm. Governments cannot force airlines to reduce their prices. \nThere might be many planes sat on the ground at airports round the world. But the airline industry is highly regulated and getting the right permissions and slots takes time. \nOh, and the Royal Air Force does not have enough transport planes to solve the crisis, in case you were wondering. \nFor all the many difficulties that some British nationals are experiencing, many others are getting home. \nAccording to the FCO, more than 200,000 Britons have been helped to return home from Spain since the authorities announced travel restrictions. \nSince March 16, when Egypt first began suspending flights, the Cairo embassy has helped more than 12,000 Britons return home on 53 flights. \nOver the last couple of weeks, the ambassador in Morocco, Tom Reilly, and his team have helped 8,500 British nationals get home on 49 commercial flights despite the travel restrictions. \nMore than 1,900 Britons have been repatriated on special charter flights from cruise ships docking in Japan, California and Cuba. \nSome 1,400 have come back on FCO charters from Peru and China. About 4,000 have been helped back from Jamaica. \nAround 500 have left Bali after the FCO helped unblock visa complications. \nAnd the FCO has persuaded Qatar Airlines to open up their route from Australia, providing 3,500 seats for Britons each day since last Friday. \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52010555": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-52010555", "title": "Coronavirus: What are the current restrictions and why are they needed?", "published": "Wed, 01 Apr 2020 18:11:02 GMT", "summary": "The new measures will see shops closed and groups dispersed in order to fight coronavirus.", "story": "A series of strict measures to fight the coronavirus outbreak has been introduced by the government. \nThey are aimed at stopping the spread of infection by making people stay at home unless absolutely necessary.

The only exceptions are:\nIn addition, the government has stopped weddings, baptisms and other religious ceremonies, apart from funerals.\nThe restrictions were announced on 23 March by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with the plan to review them after three weeks. \nThe police have been given powers to make sure people follow the measures.\nIf you leave your home or gather in public for any reason other than those allowed, the police may instruct you to go home or disperse. They may also instruct you to stop your children from also breaking the rules. They also have the power to take you home or arrest you. \nIf the police believe you have broken rules, or if you refuse to follow their instructions, they may issue you with a fine of \u00a360 (reduced to \u00a330 if paid within 14 days). If it's the second time you've received a fine, the amount will increase to \u00a3120 and double on each further repeat offence.\nThe guidance says that \"the police will act with discretion and common sense in applying these measures\". \nLocal authorities (such as trading standards officers) will be monitoring local businesses to make sure they also follow the rules.

Some are likely to be anxious, so how can parents help them cope?\nNo school for the \"foreseeable\" future. Exams off. Clubs closed.\nMillions of children will be looking forward to a spring, and possibly a summer, free of responsibility and routine. But these are not normal times - they're likely to have to spend days and nights indoors with parents or guardians.\nThey won't get much personal contact with friends and, for teenagers, the cancellation of exams will make a difficult time of year even more worrying.\n\"It's the perfect storm for parents and children,\" says Sam Cartwright-Hatton, professor of clinical child psychology at the University of Sussex.\n\"It's not just the fact that they're going to be cooped up together. Emotions are also going to be super-stressed because - on top of what young people are feeling - parents are worried about jobs, food supplies, paying the next mortgage bill.\"\nAs households begin this forced experiment in enclosed living, Prof Cartwright-Hatton advocates setting a clear routine, particularly for younger children - such as a couple of hours of school work in the morning or a specified time for craft work in the afternoon.\nShe argues that pre-teenage children \"turn inwards quite quickly\" if they spend too much time alone.\nParents should play with them and encourage those of an adventurous nature to regard the situation as an \"adventure\". This approach won't work for the more sensitive children who will need extra reassurance.\nProf Cartwright-Hatton recommends keeping classmates and members of clubs like Brownies, football teams and music groups in touch via Skype, FaceTime, Zoom or other video-conferencing services. This would allow them to share details of their day and play games.\n\"I would worry about a child who had no-one to play with for six months. We're going to have to get creative in keeping children connected to their peer groups. Kerplunk won't work on Skype, but Cluedo or Monopoly might.\"\nGoing out won't be as easy as it usually is, which could add to a feeling of claustrophobia as spring and summer approach. Those with gardens are encouraged to use them for fresh air and exercise.\n\"A balance has to be struck between mental and physical health, depending on what the next piece of official information is,\" says Eva Lloyd OBE, professor of early childhood at the University of East London. \n\"If it's safe to go the park, people should do that too.\"\nIt's impossible to shield all but the youngest children from coronavirus talk, particularly with parents turning on TVs at 17:00 GMT for the latest government briefing.\nBut Prof Cartwright-Hatton suggests not exposing under-10s to any news at all, except in tailored forms such as the BBC's Newsround, which consults experts on its likely psychological impact.\nTeenagers are better equipped to make their own judgements, but they should not be left in their rooms for hours on end searching the internet or using social media unsupervised, she warns.  \nAnother potential outcome of so much information coming children's way - along with a great deal of advice, such as standing two metres away from grandparents to avoid possible transmission - is \"guilt\", says Prof Lloyd.\n\"I worry that they'll wonder whether this is happening because of something they've done,\" she adds. \"It's a very strange situation for them. We've got to show them that none of this is their fault and that children throughout the world are going through the same experience.\"\nCoronavirus news is grim for people of all ages, but parents can offer perspective.\n\"Downplay their fears but be realistic,\" says Prof Cartwright-Hilton. \"Don't promise things that you can't be sure aren't true. If there's misinformation about the number of deaths from coronavirus, you can counter that.\n\"But, whenever you've discussed coronavirus, move on afterwards, so children don't spend too much time thinking about it.\"\nStudents who were due to take their GCSEs, A-levels, Highers and other exams have had them cancelled. They don't know when or if they will go ahead at a future date.\nTeenagers who would otherwise be revising could now be at home wondering how they will get their qualifications.\n\"I'd listen and be very sympathetic,\" says Prof Cartwright-Hatton. \"Whatever emotions the situation is throwing up, tell them you understand how awful it must be at the moment and what a shame it is.\n\"But let them know you can't solve this for them. If they are really catastrophising about it - worrying that they won't go to university and won't get a job - correct that, because it's not the case.\"\nThe situation the UK finds itself in is new for parents and children.\nProf Lloyd says families should hold a \"review\" at the end of every week to discuss how the arrangement is faring.\n\"It's going to be challenging,\" she says. \"If it's not working, people will need to change it. We should include the children in discussions. From the age of about two they will want to have an input.\"\nDiscussions between parents over their own coronavirus worries can wait until after children have gone to bed, Prof Lloyd adds.\nAt the best of times, children are inclined to ask: \"Are we nearly there yet?\" or \"Is it nearly over?\" Explaining the word \"indefinite\" might prove problematic.\n\"For young children that's an emerging concept,\" says Prof Lloyd. \"You get them to imagine the summer holidays, that it would be long like them, but not so much fun.\"\nIt's a daunting prospect for parents, taking over what the state has offered for well over a century - daytime education and childcare. But might there be another way of looking at things to ensure the coming weeks and months are more bearable?\n\"We often talk about work-life balance and parents not being able to spend enough time with kids,\" says Prof Cartwright-Hatton. \"That's not going to be a problem for a lot of people for quite a while now.

This is because you haven't yet have filed a tax return, which is needed to help calculate financial support.\nHMRC will contact those who are eligible.\nYou will have to try to claim benefits - such as universal credit and/or contribution-based employment and support allowance (ESA).\nIn his recent Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said claimants could apply for ESA straight away, rather than waiting a week. He also temporarily removed the minimum income floor (MIF) criteria for self-employed people - which looked at how much people could expect to earn in a month to calculate levels of universal credit.\nNot having the floor self-employed people not covered by the Coronavirus Self-employment Income Support Scheme can now access universal credit in full, to receive a payment equivalent to statutory sick pay (SSP).\nThe requirement to attend a job centre to apply for universal credit is also being relaxed - you will be able to apply on the phone or online.\nLevels of benefit have also been increased temporarily.\nYou should continue to work and have your wages paid as normal, even if you are home-working or have been told to work at another location temporarily.\nIf you can work from home, you should do so. Working hours can still be clearly defined.\nEmployers still have a duty of care and are responsible for any equipment they give you. The Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service (Acas) has set out guidance.\nIf you are an employee, your employer must give you time off in an emergency. But you might not get paid - it depends on the terms of your work contract.\nHowever, many bosses during this period are allowing parents to work flexibly, to try to manage both work and childcare. \nIf you are an employee, any sick pay you may receive will depend on where you work.\nSome workers' contracts offer full pay to those off ill - albeit for a limited time.\nIf that time runs out, or if you don't get paid sick leave in the first place, you should receive statutory sick pay (SSP).\nThe money - set at \u00a394.25 a week - is paid by employers for up to 28 weeks. So if you are self-employed, you will not be eligible - but if you are a casual or agency worker, you will be.\nTo receive SSP you need to be earning at least \u00a3118 a week. The Office for National Statistics estimates there are 1,766,000 adult jobs in the UK that pay less than that amount - although some people will earn money from several jobs over the course of a week.\nSSP can now be claimed from a person's first day away from work, rather than the fourth day as before.\nAnyone claiming should be able to get a sick note from the NHS's 111 service rather than their GP.\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-51632801": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/explainers-51632801", "title": "Coronavirus: What next in the UK coronavirus fight?", "published": "Mon, 23 Mar 2020 12:53:15 GMT", "summary": "The UK's plan to tackle coronavirus has been changing.

The NUM's eventual defeat, and the subsequent closure of the UK's deep coalmines meant that, for many trade unionists, Tories became hate figures.\nMargaret Thatcher, prime minister at the time, branded striking miners' leaders \nSo how are relations between Tories and unions these days?\n\"The problem is there's always a Pavlov's dog reaction on both sides,\" says Mr Halfon. \"You mention Tories to trade unions and they say 'no way.' And, on the Tory side, mention unions and they just think of strikes and pickets. And trade unionism is much bigger than that.\"\nMr Halfon, honorary president of the Conservatives' Union Blue group, wants his party to change its pitch to potential members. Like some unions, it should offer perks such as private healthcare and travel discounts, legal representation, and better access to loans and insurance, he argues.\n\"It can't be gimmicks,\" Mr Halfon, MP for Harlow, in Essex, says. \"People aren't going to join for a Nando's card. This is revolutionary for the Conservative Party and it would be a very, very different model of membership.\n\"Nowadays you can join the party by the internet, which is great. But what do you get for joining? Absolutely nothing, apart from letters asking for money and voting in a leadership contest or for a candidate.\"\nBut there is one perk common to Conservative and Working Men's Clubs, he says. \n\"They're very good because you can actually get a pint of Guinness for a very decent price.\"\nAt December's general election, Boris Johnson's party made incursions into areas where Labour - and unions - once dominated political life. The County Durham seats of Bishop Auckland and Sedgefield, formerly held by Tony Blair, were among those that turned blue.\nSupport for Brexit and Mr Johnson's promise to \"get it done\" is cited as a major cause. After his election win, the prime minister acknowledged that many lifelong Labour voters had part of the \"enemy within\". and vowed to repay them.\n\"I think the elections made a huge difference to our party,\" Mr Halfon says. \n\"There are more Tory MPs who have been trade union members than before. The party should make it its main mission to support trade unionism as a model.\n\"People have got to think imaginatively. We live in an atomised society and I want institutions that bring people together.\"\nIn 1953, the Conservative Party \"lent\" the Conservatives their backing By last year the figure, had an estimated 2.8 million members., was 180,000.\nTrade unions, at their peak in the late 1970s, had around 12 million members. Since then several laws have come into force aimed at making industrial action harder to organise  - most notably those passed under Mrs Thatcher's Conservative government.\n\"Both we and the unions have seen a decline, but the Conservative Party would give our right hands to have millions of members,\" says Mr Halfon.\nOf the 48 unions comprising the Trades Union Congress (TUC), \nMr Halfon, himself a member of the non-party-aligned Prospect union, suggests the Tory leadership can work with \"moderate\" and \"sensible\" trade unionists, without allowing legalising now banned practices like closed shops and secondary picketing.\nHe has even suggested that a union could become affiliated to the Conservative Party, but there is little sign of this happening soon.\n\"You have to repeat the message again and again and again before anything gets changed,\" Mr Halfon says.\nHe and Len McCluskey, general secretary of the huge Labour-backing Unite union and a vocal supporter of Jeremy Corbyn as party leader, had a \"constructive discussion\" a few years ago, he adds. \nBut what does the TUC - like most of its members officially politically neutral - think?\n\"I've met Robert Halfon on a number of occasions,\" says general secretary Frances O'Grady. \"He's somebody we may not agree with on many things, but he clearly sees a role for trade unions in doing the bread and butter of making sure that people get a fair deal at work. \n\"How others [in the Conservative Party] think, we have yet to find out.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51357589": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51357589", "title": "Brexit trade deal: What do the UK and EU want?", "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2020 13:34:10 GMT", "summary": "The UK and EU have set out their stalls for negotiations on their future relationship.", "story": "Trade negotiations tend not to begin with two sides in agreement - otherwise there would be nothing to negotiate. \nSo it's not surprising to see the UK and EU set out rather different positions before talks begin in earnest.  \nThere are some broad similarities. The two sides agree they want a free-trade agreement, with no tariffs (border taxes on goods) or quotas (limits on the amount of goods). They are also keen to include as much of the service sector as possible. \nBut that's the easy bit and this is likely to become a bruising experience for all involved. \nTerms and conditions always apply - and there are several possible flashpoints.\nFirst and foremost, the EU wants the UK to sign up to strict rules on fair and open competition, so if British companies are given tariff-free access to the EU market, they cannot undercut their rivals. \nThese are known as level playing field guarantees and they have been a constant theme in the EU's negotiating position for nearly two years.  \nMost importantly, its negotiating directives, adopted on 25 February 2020, say a future partnership must \"ensure the application\" in the UK of EU state-aid rules on subsidies for business. \nThe UK would also be required to stay in line with the EU's rules on environmental policy and workers' rights in a way that would \"stand the test of time\".\nBut the government has now rejected this approach entirely. The political declaration it agreed with the EU last year did speak of level playing field commitments but, armed with a big majority in the House of Commons, it has toughened up its language.In a document outlining the UK's approach to negotiations published on 27 February 2020, it said: \"we will not agree to any obligations for our laws to be aligned with the EU's\".\nInstead, Boris Johnson has said he would create an independent system that would uphold the UK's international obligations and not undermine European standards. \n\"There is no need for a free-trade agreement to involve accepting EU rules on competition policy, subsidies, social protection, the environment or anything similar,\" he said.\nHe has also pointed out that there are areas such as maternity rights in which the UK has higher standards than the EU and that the UK spent far less money on state aid than Germany or France.  \nThe EU says without a level playing field, it cannot offer any kind of basic free-trade agreement along the lines of the one it has negotiated with Canada. \nThe UK's response? A Canada-style deal would be its preference, but if that is not available, it will settle for what Australia has with the EU. In other words, no free-trade deal at all. \nThe government says it will decide in June 2020 \"whether good progress has been possible on the least controversial areas of the negotiations\" (which it defines as things like financial services and data) and if not, it will start to focus on preparing for a new relationship without a formal free-trade deal. \nEither way, says Mr Johnson, a new relationship will begin on 1 January 2021. \nHis critics accuse him of recklessness, but the prime minister says he has \"no doubt that in either case the UK will prosper\".\nThe EU has said an agreement on fisheries must be concluded before any free-trade deal is finalised. That's because UK fishing waters are among the best in Europe. \nThe UK says it's happy to consider a deal on fisheries but it must be based on the notion \"British fishing grounds are first and foremost for British boats\". \nThe EU sees things rather differently.\nIts negotiating directives say a future deal should \"aim to avoid economic dislocation for [European] Union fishermen that have traditionally fished in United Kingdom waters\".\nThe EU wants to \"uphold\" existing access on both sides to fishing waters - language that has strengthened under pressure from EU countries with big fishing fleets.\nThe EU also seems prepared to link access to fishing waters to the UK's ability to sell its fish in the EU market.  \nBut the UK also rejects that. Michael Gove told Parliament: \"We will take back control of our waters, as an independent coastal state, and we will not link access to our waters to access to EU markets. Our fishing waters are our sovereign resource.\" \nFishing is a tiny part of both sides' economies - in the UK it's well below 1% - but it has always been an emotional issue. And coastal communities depend on it on both sides of the Channel.  \nWhen it comes to product standards and other regulations, the EU is a bit more flexible. \n\"We're not asking for alignment, I know it's a red rag to the UK, so I won't really mention it,\" the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier said. \n\"What I am looking for is consistency.\"\nThe UK says it must have the right to diverge from EU rules when it chooses to do so, but it won't do that just for the sake of doing things differently. \nThe more it diverges, the more checks there will be and the more barriers to trade will emerge. \nOne late addition to the EU's negotiating document is the demand that the UK should stick close to EU rules on food safety and animal health, which is seen by some as a reference to whether the UK might import chlorine-washed chicken from the US in the future.\nSimilar trade-offs will have to be made in the services sector. UK financial services companies, for example, will lose the passporting rights that gave them unfettered access to the rest of the EU. \nInstead, the UK is hoping for a system of what's known as enhanced equivalence, which would give companies plenty of notice if the rules were about to change. \nBut talk in government circles of frictionless trade has gone. The UK now accepts that will not be possible outside the EU single market and customs union. \nThe EU's negotiating mandate recalls a statement made back in 2018, in which the other 27 member states agreed Gibraltar would not be included in any post-Brexit agreement between the UK and the EU. \nIt doesn't rule out a separate deal between the UK and the EU that does cover Gibraltar, but that in turn would have to be agreed by the UK and Spain.\nThis is another hot-button issue pretty much guaranteed to generate tabloid headlines.   \nMr Johnson has said he would be negotiating for what he called the whole UK family, including Gibraltar.  \nGaining independence from the rulings of the European Court of Justice (ECJ) was an important part of the argument for Brexit. \nNow, the EU is demanding the ECJ be given a legal role in policing any free-trade agreement. \nIt wants the court to be able to issue binding rulings on disputes between the two sides, when they \"raise a question of interpretation of [European] Union law\".\nBut the government's outline says it will not allow \"the EU's institutions, including the Court of Justice, to have any jurisdiction in the UK\".\nThe ECJ does play a limited role in the withdrawal agreement, both in the special arrangements for Northern Ireland and in resolving any disputes over citizens' rights for the next few years.\nBut a future trade deal is a different matter. \nDevising a dispute-resolution system that satisfies both sides will not be easy. \nIt's not just about trade, it's about internal security co-operation and access to databases too. \n\"Where a partnership is based on concepts derived from European law,\" Michel Barnier said, \"obviously the ECJ should be able to continue to play its role in full\".\nThe EU's mandate also says there should be \"automatic termination\" of law enforcement and judicial co-operation in criminal matters if the UK were to opt out of the European Convention on Human Rights. \nThe bottom line for the UK? The ECJ and the EU's legal order \"must not constrain the autonomy of the UK's legal system in any way\". \nSo there are some big divides to be bridged. \nBoth sides are accusing the other of moving the goalposts and backing away from commitments made in the non-binding political declaration.\nMany observers expect a serious row and a possible breakdown in the talks sooner rather than later.   \nOn the other hand, both the UK and the EU say they would settle for a free-trade agreement. The difficult part will be working out how to get there and how to implement it.  \nIt is also worth recalling the government's own internal analysis from November 2018 suggested a Canada-style deal would leave the economy 4.9% smaller after 15 years than if the UK had stayed in the EU. \nThere is a long way to go in a short period of time. \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51679944": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51679944", "title": "The decade that shattered trust in politics", "published": "Sat, 29 Feb 2020 00:08:19 GMT", "summary": "Laura Kuenssberg explores the scandals that shook faith in elites at the start of the 21st century.", "story": "Who do you trust? \nThat's no small question. But it's a fundamental one when it comes to politics. \nFor democracy to work well, voters have to have at least a modicum of faith that when politicians are taking decisions they are doing it in our best interests, or at least they are doing what they perceive to be the right thing even if you believe they are wildly wrong. \nThere's little doubt that the agonies of the Brexit process saw trust being stretched to breaking point. \nWhile in such an era of political controversy there has been huge concern, thousands of column inches and hours of discussion on the airwaves about the damage that's been done, the British public didn't just wake up one morning and decide that their politicians were a bunch of charlatans. \nAnd there were plenty of reasons why voters had concerns about whether they could trust them long before a certain campaign group put a certain number on the side of a red bus. \nIt seems a different age, but there were dramatic events in the previous decade that certainly undermined the relationship between the public and those in power. \nAnd in a new documentary, The Decade of Distrust, to be aired on BBC Radio 4 on Saturday evening, we delve into the archive of 2000 to 2010.\nWe revisit the political controversies of the Iraq war, the jaw-dropping revelations of the MPs' expenses scandal, the estimate-busting increase in immigration, the horror of Harold Shipman's murders and, more than anything else, the financial crash, the moment when the foundations of the economy and the basis of our political assumptions simply fell away. \nThe programme takes us from Gordon Brown's living room in Fife and George Osborne's editor's office at the Evening Standard in London back in time. \nIt was almost eerie to talk to those two about how the crash unfolded and the impact it had on our faith in the political system. \nThe former prime minister now believes the people lost trust not because his government made mistakes in handling the crisis, but because they didn't explain to the public what was happening. \nHe told me: 'We didn't communicate properly, and trust was lost because of that. \n\"I look back to Roosevelt who did Saturday night radio broadcasts, I kept thinking what is the medium to get our message across? \n\"People wanted gameshows. Social media was becoming big but we didn't really realise the power of it. \n\"So we didn't get our message across properly, we didn't explain it's a banking crisis, it was worldwide, we had an answer.\" \nGeorge Osborne reflects that the combination of events in those years, the \"rabbit punches of the expenses scandal, and of the bailing out of the banks\" created a climate where people found it harder to trust the government, with consequences we are still living with today, although he jokes that the cartoons he publishes in the paper he edits now are far less rude than those in previous centuries. \nBritish voters have always been a healthily sceptical bunch. \nPoliticians have never exactly been held up as paragons of virtue.  \nBut it is hard for any political generation to restore the public's faith and trust once it has gone, and the first 10 years of this century set the scene for the turmoil in the UK we have just all lived through. \nYou can listen to our documentary tonight on BBC Radio 4 at 2000 GMT and on BBC Sounds afterwards. \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51575095": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/51575095", "title": "Brexit: How do you negotiate a trade agreement?", "published": "Fri, 21 Feb 2020 01:02:22 GMT", "summary": "There are a lot of negotiations to be done this year.

That is the point of Brexit.\"\nSo what do you need to think about when you're preparing for trade negotiations?\n\"What do you want? That's probably the first thing you have to be absolutely crystal clear on,\" says Emily Jones, who runs the global economic governance programme at the Blavatnik School, at Oxford University.    \n\"There's a lot of trade-offs in doing a trade deal and it's really important to be clear about what your priorities are and how you rank them.\" \nFishing is a good example. It's a tiny part of the overall economy in the UK and the EU but both sides have already insisted they see it as a priority.  \nSo what might either side be willing to concede in one sector to get what they want in another? \nIt's worth remembering most deals are about getting rid of barriers to trade and moving closer together - but this negotiation will be about moving further apart. \nIt's also important to know what the other side at the negotiating table wants to achieve. \nTo do that, you need to understand the politics they are grappling with and the legal and institutional constraints they face. \n\"It's important to think about what the final deal will look like,\" Ms Jones says, \"you have to define the landing zone.\"  \nA deal has to be acceptable to both sides; otherwise - in the end - it will fail. This is the core of the UK's argument that the EU needs to see this as a negotiation between sovereign equals. \nOf course, there will be more lurid headlines on trade in the coming months. \nIn the end though, after all the shouting, when both sides need a deal, there will need to be realism about what can be achieved. \n\"I fear we are not as ready as we would like to be,\" says Alan Winters, director of the UK Trade Policy Observatory, \"and the time constraint is very binding.\"\n\"We are only going to get a limited number of things done and we should be realistic about that.\"\nMost trade experts believe whatever happens this year, negotiations will have to continue for some time to come.  \n\"The difficult things are where regulations are concerned,\" Mr Winters says.  \n\"So it's services, industrial regulations, food safety, chemicals and so on. It's quite straightforward to cut tariffs to zero; it's all the other stuff that takes time.\"\nThe temptation must be to push things through behind the scenes but recent history suggests too much secrecy in trade negotiations can prompt a hostile reaction. \nIn 2016, tens of thousands of Europeans marched against the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), a proposed free-trade agreement between the EU and the United States, which has now been abandoned.\n\"There was a huge backlash,\" says Bernardine Adkins, head of EU trade law at the solicitors Gowling WLG. And lessons learned then about transparency should be taken on board now. \n\"You may need to keep some of the details secret,\" she says, \"but you need to keep touching base with all your stakeholders - not only with business but with consumers and trades unions as well.\"\nSerious discussions about trade in the UK are confined mostly to expert gatherings or government meetings behind closed doors. \nBy comparison, the US has already held public consultations about a possible trade deal with the UK and the EU has published the detailed text of its draft negotiating mandate. \nIn London, there's certainly a sense of anticipation - and the government says it will set out its plans in more detail in written form. \n\"We've never done anything like this before,\" Mr Winters says. \"In a sense it's very exciting and along with excitement goes a degree of terror.\"\nAnd there are wider issues to consider. \nHow do trade deals fit in with other foreign policy goals such as security or with other domestic priorities such as reducing regional inequality or decarbonising the economy? \n\"We as a society need to have a national conversation about it in the UK,\" says Ms Jones. \n\"My deep concern at the minute is that we're going to be doing trade agreements that lock us in for the medium term or even the long term, without having thought through all the options.\"\nThe post-Brexit transition period runs out at the end of this year, so time really is tight. \nLeaving the single market and the customs union is the biggest economic change this country has made in at least 50 years. \nBut there's no doubt that change does produce opportunities. \nIn his speech in Brussels, Mr Frost said the UK would be able to be far more nimble than the EU in the future and take better advantage of new developments in the global economy. \n\"Britain will be able to experiment, correct mistakes and improve,\" he said. \"The EU is going find this much, much more difficult.\" \nThere are no guarantees at the start of any negotiating process, though, about where it will eventually end up.  \n", "pic":

If the gown is not water resistant, a waterproof apron is needed underneath to protect the wearer from droplets containing the virus.\nThe shortage of non-surgical gowns is a critical problem facing the NHS as it struggles to secure enough kit for frontline staff. \nA leaked Public Health England document this week advised health workers to reuse protective gowns and masks only as a \"last resort\".\nAs the world fights coronavirus, the demand for gowns is at levels never seen before. \nAlmost all of the UK's gowns used by the NHS are made in China and the Far East.\nThese decisions have been driven by cost, as all sectors seek the cheapest prices. \nBut as every country in the world fights for finite supplies, a UK solution has been sought. \nThe government and management consultancy Deloitte approached well known UK garment brands asking if they could help make PPE.\nThey also requested that UK manufacturers complete a survey to share what they could make.\nEarlier this week, Barbour began distributing gowns from its factory in the north-east of England.\nBurberry is still making the final adjustments to its factory and production is expected to start next week.\nGetting a supply chain formalised using UK factories has been difficult.\nUK garment factories approached by the BBC have said the government does not fully understand what is possible in the UK, and which firms could produce what. This lack of understanding has caused production delays.\nDelays around certification of gowns for use is also slowing down the manufacturing process.\nSome factories say it could be another two weeks before the necessary paperwork is signed off and they can manufacture the gowns.\nThis comes as factories around the UK are empty. Machinists and pattern cutters have been sent home and furloughed.\nTo add to the frustration of factory bosses, they say they're getting upsetting calls from NHS hospitals and workers begging for gowns.\nA Department for Health and Social Care spokesman said: \"Adequate supply of protective equipment is an international issue facing many countries during this global pandemic.\" \nNearly one billion pieces of protective equipment had been delivered to the frontline so far, the spokesman said.\n\"There is also a 24-hour NHS-run helpline where NHS and social care workers can call to report supply disruption. \n\"We continue to work around the clock to give the NHS and the wider social care sector the equipment they need and it is crucial the guidance for protective equipment is followed closely,\" the spokesman added.\nPlease include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

They then laundered the dirty money by buying and selling black market gold.\nDocuments seen by Panorama and French news agency Premieres Lignes showed that Renade International - a company owned by a member of the money laundering gang - sold $146m (\u00a3114m) of gold to Kaloti in 2012 alone.\nTwenty-seven members of the money laundering gang were jailed in France in 2017. Kaloti denies any wrongdoing.\nPanorama saw a number of drafts of a Kaloti compliance report to a Dubai regulator. In the initial report, Kaloti seemed to admit buying gold coated with silver. It said: \"We acknowledge an incident\u2026 with the bars coated with silver.\"\nBut EY rewrote the report so that it said: \"We acknowledge transactions... in which there were certain documentary irregularities.\"\nThe accountancy firm turned the crime into a \"documentary irregularity\".\nOn Friday Mr Justice Kerr ruled that EY's behaviour amounted to professional misconduct, and that EY bosses were \"responsible for suggesting to Kaloti that it should draft its compliance report in a manner that masked the reality of the Morocco gold issue\"\nThe court found EY breached the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants, and that it had a duty of care to take reasonable steps to protect Mr Rihan \"against economic loss, in the form of loss of future employment opportunity, by providing an ethically safe work environment, free from professional misconduct\"\nThe court awarded Mr Rihan $10,843,941 in US dollars and \u00a3117,950 in damages. \nMr Rihan said: \"Almost seven years of agony for me and my family has come to an end with a total vindication by the court. My life was turned upside down as I was cruelly and harshly punished for insisting on doing my job ethically, professionally and lawfully in relation to the gold audits in Dubai.\" \n\"I really hope EY will use this judgement as an opportunity to improve - to avoid such events happening again in the future,\" he added. \nMr Rihan's solicitor Paul Dowling from law firm Leigh Day said: \"I am delighted that our client has finally received justice in his case. This important judgment sends a clear message to would-be whistleblowers that they do not have to tolerate unethical conduct within their organisation, no matter how high up the chain it goes.\"\nEY has told the BBC it is \"surprised and disappointed by the judge's decision\" and will appeal the ruling.\nIn a statement, EY said: \"It was the work of an EY Dubai assurance team that uncovered serious irregularities and reported them to the proper authorities. Their work ultimately resulted in sanctions against the refiner and contributed to significant changes in the sourcing of precious metals and the regulation of refiners in Dubai\". \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52308823": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52308823", "title": "Coronavirus: 'We could end up with no business or savings'", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:34:09 GMT", "summary": "People who run small limited companies say they are unfairly missing out on government support.", "story": "Andy Shaw, 57, has built up a painting and decorating firm with his brother-in-law Jake, but has now seen work dry up owing to the coronavirus lockdown.\n\"We could come out of this with no business or savings, it would be absolutely devastating,\" he says.\nWhy? Because the business is a limited company and the duo are company directors who pay themselves in dividends. Like hundreds of thousands of people running their businesses the same way, they will get little or no state support. \nHis firm has been able to furlough, or put on state-paid leave, its two full-time members of staff to take off some of the pressure. But he and Jake will personally be eligible for much less, as they pay themselves in dividends, which the government will not cover.\n\"We can furlough ourselves for the small basic salaries we take, but that will only leave us with \u00a3600 a month, which doesn't cover my outgoings at all,\" says Andy, from Uttoxeter, Staffordshire.\nBy furloughing themselves, they would not be allowed to work on anything that brings in money for the business, only organisational work as a director.\n\"It means we won't be able to work at a time when our business is on the brink,\" he says.\nThere is a real prospect he might have to shut up shop and lay off his staff.\nTurning from a sole trader into a limited company has been popular in the past, with small business owners - from marketing agents to milkmen - becoming company directors and using the professional-sounding title that comes with it.\nHistorically, it saved on their tax bill, although that benefit has been considerably watered down in recent times.\nFor many, the attraction was to separate personal finances from that of the business and to protect themselves as individuals if something went wrong with a supplier or customer. \nEven that benefit can be reduced if, for example, banks still require the business owner's home as collateral for a loan.\nLike so many businesses, they are now facing difficulties in the light of the coronavirus restrictions, and the choice of becoming a limited company looks set to be an expensive one.\nThe government has said it will pay 80% of employed and self-employed workers' incomes, up to \u00a32,500 a month, for three months if they are furloughed.\nBut it will not cover dividends, because it says there is no way of telling whether people have received them in lieu of wages or as a return on capital in their own company or an investment.\nThis means people such as Andy and Jake, who pay themselves mostly in dividends, say that typically furlough pay - covering 80% of what they pay themselves as a salary - would typically give them about \u00a3585 per month, making it difficult to put food on the table after business and personal bills are paid.\nCampaigners point out that most company directors are not especially wealthy, with many running small firms or operating by themselves.\n\"These are real, hard-working people who have built up successful businesses and paid taxes all their lives, who now find themselves facing hardship with little of the current support available for them,\" says Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses.\nSome 327,000 people have signed a petition calling on the government to change course. One remedy, they argue, is for dividend income to be included in the calculations for furlough, rather than only a salary.\nAlthough the small business minister has offered some support, and Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he is open to ideas, there is no plan from the Treasury to change its policy as yet.\n\"Those who do not qualify for the support schemes will be able to access a range of other measures,\" a Treasury spokeswoman says, including income tax referrals and mortgage holidays.\nNick Steele, 46, is one of many who say they set up as a limited company on the encouragement of one government, only now to be treated inferiorly by another.\nHe and his partner have run a hospitality recruitment company in Gloucestershire since 2006, but since the epidemic hit, all of their work has evaporated.\n\"Back then, I think they thought it was more controllable and easier to tax limited companies. Now it seems this government wants to crush us,\" he says.\n\"I have no choice but to sell personal possessions and borrow money. For the record, I can't get a government grant because I have no premises; I might be able to get a loan, but I don't want to take that risk.\"\nHe thinks the government is uninterested in supporting limited company directors because of a perception they pay less tax.\nBut the recruitment professional, who earns about \u00a345,000 a year, mainly in dividends, says he pays \"no more or less tax than self-employed or employed people\". He also points out he is not entitled to government subsidised benefits such as statutory sick pay.\n\"I'm not some high net worth individual, I'm not squirrelling money away. I fill out a tax return every year, it's just that in one column I state my income from PAYE, and in another the income from dividends.\n\"The government's policy just doesn't stack up.\"\nSonali Joshi, 45, whose business provides access services to the film industry, such as subtitles and audio descriptions, says she is struggling to make ends meet.\n\"While we have plenty of ideas of how to reconfigure our business during this difficult time, we need investment to do this and right now we have nothing.\"\nShe says they cannot access a Coronavirus Business Interruption Loan, according to their bank, because their 2019 turnover was less than \u00a3100,000.

Now it's slowly getting back to work, but don't expect that to save the rest of us. It won't be enough as the latest numbers show us.\nChina's GDP shrank by 6.8% for the first three months of the year - its first year-on-year contraction in decades, in fact since records started. It's a sign of how hard it will be to restart all our economies. \nFirst off, China's economic data always comes with the caveat: don't believe what you read. Independent economists always say the figures are much lower than what the government says.  But this year's first-quarter economic data was always going to be bad. \nThey confirm that the lockdown exacted unavoidable significant pain on the economy. But it doesn't end here. Almost every economist I've spoken to says that things will get worse before they get better. \nSo if you were hoping that any growth momentum in the coming quarters will help the rest of us - think again. \nThe World Bank says in the base case scenario, China will see growth fall to 2% this year from 6% last year - and if things get worse, it would see growth fall to 0.1%. That's basically no growth. \nWhatever Beijing manages to eke out from now will not be enough for the rest of us to hitch our wagons to in the hopes of a recovery. \nDespite the grim first-quarter news, companies are starting to get back to work in China - albeit slowly.\nIn a survey of its members from the end of March, \n said that nearly a quarter of their companies expect a return to normal business operations by the end of April, while 22% had already resumed normal operations.\nSome 40% say they will keep their investment levels in line with what had previously been planned - so no job cuts there or scaling back of factories. \nThat momentum is being mirrored on a much greater scale domestically. \n\"Last month, my contacts in China said they weren't going out, period,\" Vinesh Motwani, managing director of Silk Road Research told me. \n\"Now, they're slowly going back to work - and even grabbing after-work beers.\" \nMr Motwani says the data he's tracked is encouraging, showing that most businesses in China will be back to 100% by May, with demand somewhere in the 60-100% range, depending on the industry. \nBut almost 20% of China's economy is made up of exports, according to \n - selling goods to the rest of us.\nGlobal demand is key to its recovery. And with most of Europe, the US and UK - its biggest customers - at home during the lockdown, there's not much optimism about that kicking back in anytime soon. \nWhen China put parts of the country in lockdown in January, starting with Wuhan and then extending to other cities, the proverbial excrement \"hit the fan\", as one Singapore-based exporter told me. \nHe sources 90% of his goods from China - everything from kitchen gadgets to cleaning items. Demand from his American customers was soaring, but because of the lockdown, he couldn't source anything. He had to tell his customers in the US that we had no idea when the lockdown might end.\nBut fast-forward two months and \"it's as if nothing happened\", he says. \n\"Factories are fulfilling orders in record time,\" he said. \"And now the things I'm sourcing are masks and hand sanitisers - that's the only thing my customers in the US want. Factories that made kitchen supplies before are now making masks.\"\nThat demand from the rest of the world IS showing up in data from China. Shipments picked up last month as factories reopened, according to think tank Capital Economics. \nBut it warned that \"with economic activity in the rest of the world now collapsing\", the worst is still to come for China's export sector. \nForeign demand will slump this quarter, the think tank says, as Covid-19 weighs on economic activity outside China. \nAnd it's no use hoping that the Chinese consumer will help to shore up China and the global economy. \n'What is now holding the economy back is a lack of demand,' says AXA Investment Manager's Aidan Yao. \n\"This problem is particularly acute in consumer services industries, as social distancing keeps people away from restaurants, movie theatres and tourist sites.\"\nAXA says a recent broker survey of large services firms shows that while 75% to 85% of supply has been restored, demand is only running at 50% to 55% of normal levels. And many companies don't expect full normality at home to return until the second half of the year. \nOn top of all of those challenges, new coronavirus cases and re-infections are risking China's tepid economy recovery. It is clear the government hasn't ruled out locking down clusters or hot spots again if it needs to, which could lead to more severe economic outages in the future. \n\"China's governance system allowed it to go through a hard lockdown nationwide,\" says Mr Motwani, \"with a very gradual resumption of activity over the course of two months as it prioritised containment over economic activity.\"\nChina itself won't be immune to job losses either. The official unemployment rate - which at the best of times is highly doubted - rose to 6.2% in February, its highest on record.\nBeijing does have the firepower to fight some of this, specifically to help out its small and medium-sized enterprises. \nThe central bank has been cutting some of China's interest rates: short-term loans to corporates jumped in March after this.  But survival is key for these firms right now - and more help may be needed to give these companies a lifeline. \nIn the last global financial crisis, China spent close to $600bn (\u00a3478bn) on stimulus, and that helped to lift the rest of the world's economic engine. But that also put massive debt risk into the Chinese system - something Beijing simply doesn't have the appetite for right now. \nWhich means banking on China's growth to help the rest of us get through the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression is not just unrealistic, it's risky. China has enough problems of its own to focus on.\nthe American Chamber of Commerce in China\ndata from the World Bank in 2018\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52318355": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52318355", "title": "Coronavirus: Treasury backs loans to bigger businesses", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 21:30:04 GMT", "summary": "Companies with a turnover of more than \u00a3500m will now be eligible for government support.", "story": "Loans to all medium-to-large firms will now be included in the government's \u00a3330bn coronavirus support package for the economy, the Treasury has said.\nAll viable companies with a turnover of more than \u00a345m will be able to apply for government-backed support, including those which take in more than \u00a3500m.\nSchemes for smaller firms and the largest businesses are already in place.\nIndustry groups welcomed the move.\nBusinesses with turnovers of more than \u00a3500m were not originally going to be eligible for the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, which will be launched on Monday.\nThe scheme, which will be part of \u00a3330bn of taxpayer money intended to support the UK economy, will let firms with a turnover of more than \u00a345m apply for up to \u00a325m of finance from banks.\nThe government will guarantee 80% on those bank loans.\nChancellor Rishi Sunak said: \"I want to ensure that no viable business slips through our safety net of support as we help protect jobs and the economy.

Its fifth location was supposed to open at the city's biggest airport this month.\nBut in March, Ms Kulaga shut her doors and laid off her staff, responding to health concerns and the drop in sales as the state restricted activity to try to slow the spread of the virus. \nShe has since applied to about 20 different aid programmes, including the new federal programme, which offers loans that do not need to be repaid if firms use 75% of the money for paying staff. Companies can re-hire former employees who have been laid off to qualify.\n\"We had serious momentum and when this happened, it's obviously devastating,\" she said.\nAs many as a quarter of small businesses fear they will not be able to survive more than two months of shutdown, according to surveys by the Chamber of Commerce and other organisations.\nSuch failures would dramatically alter the economic landscape in America, where 30 million small businesses employ almost half the country's workforce.\nMain Street America, which represents commercial districts with about 300,000 small firms, found that 7.5 million firms employing more than 35 million people are at risk of failure in the next five months.\n\"Small businesses are really losing faith that the government is going to be able to support them through this crisis,\" says Patrice Frey, the organisation's president. \"That translates into massive job losses and ultimately undermines the strength of the American economy on the other side of this.\"\nWashington, which approved the $349bn in small business loans last month as part of a bigger $2tn relief bill, is well aware it has a crisis on its hands. \nEven before running out of money, the programme - called the Paycheck Protection Program - had faced problems, including delays at some of the banks through which the government is distributing the money and criticism that the money was not reaching the smallest, most needy firms.\nDelays have also beset a separate low-cost loan scheme offered directly by the Small Business Administration through an expansion of a programme created to address disasters like hurricanes.\nThe Federal Reserve has also announced its own \"Main Street\" loan programme. But the central bank's plan, while unprecedented, is expected to reach more mid-size firms, not the small \"mom-and-pop\" shops experts say face such risk.\nThe government and many banks say some problems should be expected given the speed of roll-out. More than 1.6 million loan applications were approved for more than $339bn, the Small Business Administration said. \n\"I think it's really kind of exceptional that the government could move that quickly and that effectively,\" JP Morgan Chase boss Jamie Dimon told reporters this week, when his bank announced it had disbursed more than $9bn of roughly $37bn requested by some 300,000 applicants.\nMs Frey says those defences don't \"change the reality on the ground, which is these businesses are on the edge and unless they receive more relief immediately and with fewer hoops to jump through, these businesses are simply going to dissolve.\"\nNew Yorker Fonda Sara, who has run the Zuzu's Petals flower shop in Brooklyn for more than 40 years, is one of the people still waiting for a response from her bank about the pay cheque protection programme.\nBut even if she is ultimately approved for funds to cover wages for herself and another full-time staffer, Ms Sara says the help will do little to offset her losses as rent, utilities and other bills pile up while she misses out on spring -

And it's not looking particularly likely they'll be able to go home any time soon,\" adds Mr Chubb, who is now a director for the maritime technology intelligence platform Thetius. \nThe world's biggest shipping firm, AP Moller-Maersk, is one of those which has halted its crew changes, and says its done so to protect them, by lessening the number of social interactions they need to have. \nIt adds that \"the rapid changes to global travel poses a risk of stranding seafarers in locations from where they are unable to leave, or get sufficient assistance\".\nYet even before the coronavirus outbreak, the industry was grappling with major issues. \nFirst, the need to move to cleaner fuels because of the introduction of the 2020 sulphur emissions cap by the International Maritime Organization.\nSecond, the fallout from the US-China trade war, and the failure of Washington and Beijing to implement the first phase of their trade agreement.\n\"Shipping lines have had a very hard time making money in the past ten years,\" says Alan Murphy, chief executive of analysts Sea-Intelligence in Copenhagen.\nFor example, for a $100 (\u00a380) pair of trainers, the cost of ocean transport will be a fraction of that - just 10c. This makes the distance that goods travel to market irrelevant in cost terms. And it is why China, with its low labour costs, has become the world's main manufacturer. \nPeter Sand, chief shipping analyst with Bimco, the world's largest international shipping association, warned at a recent webinar that 2020 could become increasingly harsh for the industry.\n\"We need to make sure that local ports and terminals are kept open, to make sure that food and goods are kept flowing to where it's needed - because that's where shipping hands a lifeline to the global public.\"\nFaced with the rippling disruptions to supply and demand around the globe, shipping firms have been scaling back operations. So far, 384 sailings have been cancelled, and the first half of 2020 could see a 25% fall in shipping, with a 10% drop for the year overall, says Sea-Intelligence. \nChinese ports have resumed sailings in April, but many ports serving key consumer markets are still operating well below capacity.\nThe industry has not yet had to lower prices, but if shipping firms are forced to do so, and freight rates fall by 20% - as they did after the 2008 financial crisis - and were shipping volumes to remain 10% lower, \"we could see operating losses of some $20-23bn\", says Mr Murphy. \n\"That would wipe out the shipping firms' last eight years' worth of profits,\" he adds.\nThere are a lot of unknowns in the preceding sentences, and Sea-Intelligence stresses it is not yet clear how long it will take for fractured global supply chains to get back to normal once lockdowns are ended.\nFor consumers, there could well be periodic shortages to come, says Jody Cleworth, of consultants Marine Transport International.\n\"In developing nations like South Africa there's an almost complete shutdown in exports, whereby only critical goods are moving through ports. So the seasonal goods we expect in Europe in summer would be limited from such countries.\n\"For example, charcoal for your summer barbecue. At the moment those containers are not being moved out of South Africa, so they will not be arriving in the UK for their intended dates,\" he says.\nBut there is one exception to this gloom: the oil tanker sector. Demand for oil tankers has been rising following the oil price falls, which have sent the tanker sector \"sky-high\", says Nick Chubb of Thetius. \n\"There are ships that are being chartered now for $230,000 a day as offshore floating storage for when the oil prices recover. It's almost a tale of two industries,\" he says.\nBut given the impact of Covid-19 on economic activity, energy demand in 2020 is likely to be substantially lower, and it is possible these tankers may be storing oil for a while to come. \nMore from the \nSo what will be the effect of Covid-19 on the shipping industry beyond 2020? \nWith virtually no cargo moving by air, shipping could become even more crucial. Already 90% of world trade by volume goes by sea. Yet many analysts expect the drop in demand across Europe and North America to have a longer-term impact.\n\"We could be talking a decade, at least, of difficulty,\" suggests Nick Chubb of Thetius.\nAlan Murphy says the pandemic will trigger questions about the shape and sustainability of world trade - and globalisation. \"A lot of protectionist arguments are going to be made against outsourcing.\n\"It will have a very profound impact on how global supply chains are organised. It is going to be a political topic in coming years.\"\nOr use the form below\nIf you are happy to be contacted by a BBC journalist please leave a telephone number that we can\n                        contact you on.

And these, it seems fair to say, are far from the best of times. \nAhead of warnings the UK's economy could shrink by 35%, the Treasury set aside billions to keep businesses afloat during the coronavirus lockdown. \nBut for many, access to that funding is proving too difficult or too slow - and fewer than 2% of the 300,000 inquiries to the government's loan scheme are thought to have reached fruition so far.\nAfter being told she was not eligible for a grant because she pays business rates via her landlord, and after getting \"nowhere\" with her insurance claim, Ms Ho decided to set up a crowdfunding page for Craving Coffee, which she owns with her husband Matt.\nWithin 24 hours, they had raised two thirds of their \u00a325,000 target.\nThe team at the coffee shop were \"blown away\", Ms Ho tells the BBC. \nWithout this money, which will go towards rent, loan repayments, suppliers and utility bills, the business was set to \"go under\", she says.\n\"We were prepared to go bankrupt. We knew the lockdown would outlast any reserves we had.\"\nWhen the lockdown announcement came, they told their staff there were no more shifts and sold off as much stock as possible to recoup what they could.\n\"That was a very emotional and stressful day.\"\nBut in the end, Ms Ho says, it was the local community that saved them - with donations ranging from \u00a35 to \u00a31,000.\n\"Tottenham is really good like that. It's an area where people really get behind things,\" she says. \"I'm not surprised by the passion but I'm a little bit overwhelmed by the amounts people have given.\"\nAnd Craving Coffee is not the only business taking this approach. \nUS crowdfunding website GoFundMe says it has seen a 246% rise in British business campaigns compared with the same time last year, while UK-based Crowdfunder has also seen a spike, as well as a doubling of its daily website traffic.\nIt is important to note some crowdfunded businesses fail even in normal times, and for those investing money through crowdfunding, there is a risk of losing that money if the business goes under. However, those considering their contribution a donation may be less concerned about the risk.\nOne new scheme from Crowdfunder, to help those affected by the virus, encourages businesses to offer rewards - rather than equity - in exchange for donations.\nAt Craving Coffee, offerings ranged from drinks, food and clothing, to invitations to a reopening party.\nAnd businesses using different platforms have taken a similar approach.\nRicky Fox runs a children's entertainment company in Uxbridge.\nThe business - Captain Fantastic - employed five full-time staff and 40 entertainers before coronavirus. It was putting on about 200 children's parties a month. \nSocial distancing changed that.\n\"People starting postponing their parties,\" he says. \"We had 200 bookings a month, then it started to drop, then everyone started postponing, then they cancelled. We went down to zero.\"\nIt had taken 10 years for Mr Fox and co-founder Tommy Balaam to build up a business that ground to a halt in a matter of days.\nThey furloughed some staff, but that is where government support ended. The business operates from home offices, so they are not eligible for a grant, and both founders took dividends rather than salaries.\nRealising they needed to offer something different, Mr Fox and Mr Balaam launched free online entertainment videos for children, and asked for donations in return via GoFundMe and PayPal.\nMore than 6,000 people tuned in to their first live video, and their followers on Facebook soon rose from 3,000 to more than 50,000. \nCaptain Fantastic now does 30 live sessions a week, with the donations split between the entertainers involved in each video.\n\"It's not much at all but it pays for the staff that are left and it gives our entertainers something to pay their rent with,\" says Mr Fox.\n\"It keeps us afloat and that is what we wanted. At the moment, we can survive.\"\nThe Treasury told the BBC that local authorities were working to ensure \"eligible ratepayers\" receive the grants they are entitled to, adding that those that are not entitled to grants can still receive \"other measures\".\nBut even those who are entitled to other support are struggling to access it, or finding it is not enough.\nDave Grant is the managing director of Fierce Beer, an Aberdeen-based craft brewery that has seen its sales drop by 75% due to the lockdown.\nThe company used the government furlough scheme for some of its staff and got business rate relief - but still needed cash to survive.\nMr Grant applied for one of the government-backed loans announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak last month - but was turned down by the bank after being told his company was \"not a viable business\".\nIn the end, he turned to crowdfunding, offering people a 50% return on their pledge - \"Spend 50 quid to get 75 quid's worth of beer... it's easy for people to recognise what they're going to get.\"\nFierce Beer raised \u00a3156,000 in a day.\n\"We couldn't honestly believe it,\" says Mr Grant. \"We were constantly refreshing the total and it was unbelievable. It was so nice to think so many people wanted to help us out.\"\nSo what is it that inspires such generosity, is it simply the promise of free goods or services?\n\"I think people are starting to realise that we're going to have to work together to get through this,\" says Ms Ho.\n\"I think everyone's feeling so helpless, they just want to help where they can... and they want the business to be here when they get back.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51644033": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51644033", "title": "Should we teach children about quantum computing?", "published": "Thu, 09 Apr 2020 23:00:18 GMT", "summary": "For parents with the money, companies are offering courses in cutting-edge technology, but are they worth it?", "story": "Education will be high in the mind of many parents, particularly if they have been grappling with home learning. But what subjects should young people be studying to prepare them for the future?\nTim and Kelley McDonald enrolled their son Jack in The Knowledge Society (TKS), a part-time school for teenagers, to give him a chance to learn what he doesn't at traditional school. \n\"In my regular school we don't talk about cryptography or quantum computing, it's not in the curriculum, so for years I had to find time to learn that on my own by myself,\" says 15-year-old Jack, who is enrolled in the inaugural New York cohort of The Knowledge Society's programme.\nRecently declared as one of the \"Schools of the Future\" by the World Economic Forum think-tank, it offers education and training for 13-to-17-year-olds interested in artificial intelligence (AI) and other niche technology subjects rarely if ever taught in mainstream schools.\nBefore The Knowledge Society, Jack, who's one of four siblings and the only one enrolled in TKS, was interested in neuroscience and discussed being a brain surgeon. \nClasses at TKS have around 40 students and are held two days a week (on weekends) for three hours each day.\nThe 10-month programme is not cheap, it costs between $5,395 and $8225 (\u00a34,395 and \u00a36,700) for the 2020-21 academic year, depending on which city it is held in. \nProgrammes are currently offered in cities across North America, including Boston, Seattle, Los Angeles and Toronto, and TKS is expected to expand into London and Latin America in 2021. (Courses are currently being conducted online because of the coronavirus outbreak.)\nThe Knowledge Society's 2020-21 programme overview highlights 40 areas of focus, which includes learning about 3D printing, bionics, or wireless electricity, with the full programme lasting three years.\nSo should regular schools be offering such ambitious subjects?\nMatthew McKean, director of education and skills at the Conference Board of Canada (Canada's leading independent research body) is not sure.\n\"We run the risk of teaching young people to use technologies that may be obsolete by the time they enter the workforce,\" says Mr McKean, adding that human skills, such as communicating and building relationships, are more durable and transferable. \nAnd demand for those skills may not be as high as people expect, he argues. \"How many people actually need to know how to code or program blockchain, for example?\"\nMr McKean argues that automation and emerging technologies will only increase the need for deep human understanding and social skills. \n\"Our research confirms that the future of learning and work is social and emotional, not technical. Employers are increasingly asking for human skills, such as social and emotional intelligence, collaboration, creativity, cross-cultural competencies, relationship building, resilience and adaptability, which is placing new demands on our skills training systems,\" he says.\nMIT lecturer David Shrier, who's also written books on financial technology and blockchain, thinks schools like The Knowledge Society are great to get kids excited about opportunities in STEM subjects (science, technology, engineering and maths).\n\"A 13-year-old learning genomics makes for a good headline,\" he says, but points out the field could be radically different in four years. \n\"What will they do then without a strong base of critical thinking?\" he asks.\nThe Knowledge Society teaches critical thinking too, says co-founder Nadeem Nathoo, noting the course teaches youngsters how to organize and write down their thoughts, as well as learning how to speak confidently to an audience.\nBut he defends the value of studying cutting-edge technical subjects directly. \"If they were not exposed to this type of content or types of problems at TKS, it would be unrealistic to think to solve them,\" he says. \"I think we need to train people on the intention [to solve technical problems] from a young age, and show them these problems exist and they have the power to actually address them.\" \nAll well and good - but does that impress potential high-tech employers, who will have to choose which talented graduates to hire? Anne Martel is co-founder of Element AI, which adapts artificial intelligence (AI) for use in business.\nShe thinks a high degree of computer literacy and problem solving skills are the most important for children to be equipped with now - and learning about advanced technologies could be a good way to achieve that.\n\"When we teach our kids about AI, we teach them a technical language and take them deeper into probability and statistics. I think that is incredibly relevant for their future,\" she says.\nWhile she approves of specialised technology courses like those offered by TKS, she says broader skills are important. Curiosity, creativity and good old-fashioned grit are traits she looks for when hiring for her firm.\nThere are other options for parents who want their children to learn more about technology.\nFire Tech focuses on subjects like video game design and 3D game development, while also offering a remote learning option. Meanwhile GEMS World Academy Chicago, like TKS, has a focus on technology and the global community, offering robotics and coding lessons. \nThe Knowledge Society is certainly expensive, and many bright students could expect to excel without shelling out all that money. But Mr Nathoo argues that around half of the pupils gain paid internships which cover the cost of tuition in less than a year. \nAnd is it really healthy for teenagers to spend seven days a week studying? \"I think there's a common misconception that this is like a sweatshop for kids... it's not like that. They love doing this,\" says Mr Nathoo.\n\"There's no pressure on them, but yes, it is for people who want to accelerate their trajectory, and we're going to tap their potential.\"\nJack McDonald's parents say he spends 15 to 20 hours a week on his work from TKS and that's on top of his regular school work. \nThat's definitely not something every child would thrive on.

A world free of coronavirus.\n\"It's been really nice just to go to the game and hang out with each other,\" Mx Conway says. In Animal Crossing, players can join in a variety of activities, from fishing to playing musical instruments.\nThis is far from the only social event to have taken place in Animal Crossing since it was released. Some have even met up for dates in the game.\nWith restaurants, bars, leisure centres and other facilities closed across much of the world, people are having to find creative ways to maintain social connections, and have fun despite being stuck at home.\nWeekly game sales have risen between 40% and 60%, according to analysts at Futuresource. Much of that has been aided by the release of Animal Crossing and other new titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, which allow people to meet up in-game.\nGamers are also spending more time in virtual worlds and using more internet bandwidth to connect.\nFor many, games don't just provide a way of connecting with quarantined friends, they are also alternate universes where the reality of pandemic can be momentarily forgotten.\nBy day, Mx Conway is a delivery driver for a wine distributor. \n\"We got classed as essential retail so we're still open,\" they said.\nAlthough bars and restaurants are no longer purchasing stock, shops that sell alcohol to the public have made far larger orders than usual. After a long day at work, an online getaway in Animal Crossing beckons.\n\"It's really been wonderful just to give my time after work a little bit more structure,\" says Mx Conway.\nToday, there are hundreds of games featuring gigantic worlds that allow people to meet online. Eve Online, for example, contains 7,800 star systems where players co-operate with, or battle against, one another.\nHilmar P\u00e9tursson, chief executive of CCP Games which owns Eve Online, told the BBC that the firm had previously recorded about 7,000 new accounts per day, and then, on 14 March, that jumped to 11,000.\nThe surge coincided with the announcement of a lockdown in Spain, and followed the nationwide lockdown in Italy, on 9 March.\n\"Our game is famous for being a very social game,\" he says. \"Netflix and all that is good for passing time, but that doesn't really give you a social context. And people are craving a social context.\"\nEve Online is a demanding game, he adds, which forces people to work together to overcome various challenges in social groups, which helps players forge friendships.\nAt a time when there are so many restrictions on daily life, people are turning to games in order to satisfy certain basic psychological needs, says Prof Andrew Przybylski at the Oxford Internet Institute. \nSocialising is one such need, but so are feelings of being in control and having a choice over what one does. Games offer that even though the physical spaces around us currently may not.\nProf Przybylski himself has enjoyed dipping back in to games he mastered when he was still at school, including Starcraft and Age of Empires II.\nHe can still remember how to win when playing against the computer, and it's that familiarity which makes them comforting distractions.\n\"That sense of efficacy, that sense of control over my environment, is something that this crisis has fundamentally robbed me of,\" says Prof Przybylski.\nGames, he notes, aren't designed to fulfil all of our needs. They aren't perfect substitutes for meeting up face-to-face, for instance. They also may not be available to people who cannot easily afford them. But for those who can and do play them, games offer some respite.\n\"This is about meeting people where they are,\" says Prof Przybylski. \"It's not a panacea.\"\nAnother gamer who has sought distraction in virtual worlds is Sarisha Goodman, an education and sociology student at the University of Birmingham, who is currently living back at home in London.\n\"When I was a teenager I just always went to gaming when I was really overwhelmed, so that's kind of what I've been doing,\" she explains.\nHer games of choice are The Sims 4 and Animal Crossing. She says she could play The Sims until 03:00 most days if she wanted to. It's a simulation game that allows the player to create characters and furnish their homes. You can then observe how those characters interact with one another.\n\"We don't have that normal life any more, it's nice to see it even if it's in a game form,\" says Ms Goodman. Sometimes, she uses the smartphone app House Party to simultaneously talk to friends online while she plays.\nAs a student in her third year, Ms Goodman hasn't had time to play games for months. Now she is glad of them. She has watched some online lectures for her course, and is starting work on her dissertation. But besides that, university life has more or less been put on hold. \nThere has been a noticeable uptick in gaming since Covid-19 started to spread, confirms Morris Garrard, at market analysis firm Futuresource.\n\"We're seeing particularly strong uptake in social games, games like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone,\" he says.\nThe volume of games sold every week has risen by between 40% and 60%, and gamers are expected to spend significantly more time in games than last year, as a result of stay-at-home requirements. \nSimilar trends have been spotted in China, where Covid-19 was first detected. The mobile game Honor of Kings, for instance, clocked a 20% increase in revenue from in-game purchases during February, adds Mr Garrard.\nSteam, a PC game distribution service, recently counted 23.8 million gamers playing various games at the same time worldwide - the highest during Steam's 17-year history.\nThat's growth of roughly 15% in a fortnight says Tomas Otterbeck at Redeye AB, an investment bank.\nGames played online are also using more broadband data. US network Verizon reported a 75% increase in gaming traffic in mid-March.\n\"We can expect a 100% increase, compared to pre-Covid-19, in data usage since that report,\" says Mr Otterbeck.\nBut Prof Przybylski warns that, in such distressing times, people may need help beyond what virtual worlds can provide. Game companies should, he suggests, make it easy for troubled gamers to contact support services if needed.\n\"They need to put contact information for people who are in crisis onto their platforms,\" he explains. \"So when people need something that's not Animal Crossing, they can get to it.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52182509": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52182509", "title": "Will we ever take cruise holidays again?", "published": "Wed, 08 Apr 2020 23:10:22 GMT", "summary": "The cruise line industry faces a long journey back from the coronavirus pandemic.", "story": "David Reece and his wife Carolyn should be sipping cocktails somewhere in the Indian Ocean at the moment.\nBut their latest cruise line holiday has been cancelled because of the coronavirus outbreak. And they are missing it - as confirmed devotees of cruise vacations they have been on nearly 20 over the past two decades.\nFor the retired couple from Plymouth it all started by accident. \"I was sent to the travel agents to book a cheap holiday in the Canaries, and I came back having booked a cruise in the Red Sea,\" says David. \"Carolyn didn't talk to me for two weeks.\" \nBut they loved it, and ever since they have travelled all over the world on cruise ships; from the Baltic to the Caribbean, and from Australia to Brazil.\nFor them it is the perfect holiday, as David explains: \"We had the idea it was all about crossing the Atlantic, sitting on deckchairs with a blanket over your knees. [But in reality], the ships are really mobile hotels, and we wake up somewhere different every day\u2026 we use it to go to places we want to see.\nBut those floating hotels are now all rapidly returning to port, discharging their passengers and being mothballed. The industry has not just been devastated, it has ceased to function altogether. For it, coronavirus has been the perfect storm.\nIt has gone from being an industry worth $46bn (\u00a337bn) a year, with 26 million passengers per annum, to an almost total standstill overnight. \nIronically, the industry was well prepared for the outbreak of disease on board its ships, as it has happened plenty of times before, most often the norovirus \"vomiting bug\".\nHowever, this time the plan hit a snag, as Christopher Muller, professor of hospitality at Boston University, explains.\n\"The worst thing you can do [if passengers start falling ill] is keep people on board,\" he says. \"The plan is to go to the nearest port, get everyone off and then sanitize the ship\".\nNormally this means the ship is ready to start cruising again within a matter of weeks, but this time \"governments forced them to keep people on board\", adds Prof Muller. \"This was not the industry's fault, they would not normally have done this.\"\nThe problem was made worse by the fact that many modern cruise liners have relatively small cabins, as the industry's economic model depends on getting as many passengers as possible spending money in the ship's spas, restaurants, bars and shops.\nThe resulting bad publicity, as passengers suffered in quarantine on board ships within sight of the shore, will be difficult for the industry to shake off. \nSo, will this put the industry's rapid expansion in recent years into reverse? The sector certainly has one major problem that means it is likely to suffer more than other parts of the tourism and travel industries such as the airline sector - it has few friends in high places.\nMost cruise ships are not registered where they do business, in the USA and Europe, but offshore in places like Panama and the Bahamas.\nThe industry does that for two reasons - it saves a fortune in tax, and it means that they don't have to follow American or European labour laws. This allow the companies to recruit cheap workers from developing countries, pay them less, and work them harder.\nNow, however, avoiding taxes and hiring cheap foreign workers doesn't look so clever - the cruise line industry was specifically not included in the US's business bailout schemes. The industry may be in dire straits, but it is crying in the dark.\nAnd even if governments wanted to help, which they don't appear to, as Prof Muller points out: \"It is hard to give a tax break if they pay no taxes\". \nNot only that, but many of the destinations loved by their passengers are not missing the cruise liners very much, if at all. As Prof Sheela Agarwal, from Plymouth University's department of tourism and hospitality, puts it: \"No one is willing to bail them out because of their tax avoidance, but also because of the negative impacts they have at their destinations... they contribute very little to the local economy.\"\nCruise ships are notorious for depositing thousands of tourists in crowded cities who, Prof Agarwal says \"spend very little, look around the place for five or six hours with a packed lunch, and then go back on board for dinner\".\nSo, can the industry recover from this crisis? Well there are some good signs amidst all this gloom.\n\"Tourists have very short memories,\" says Prof Agarwal. \"This is like when a terror attack affects a destination. Look at the attacks in Paris and Brussels - three months maximum [fall in visitor numbers], and they were back to normal.\"\nAlso, it is fairly obvious what the industry will do the second that travel restrictions are lifted - they will launch a huge advertising campaign and slash their prices, to get customers back. Although as Prof Muller explains, that won't be painless.\n\"You have to have these ships pretty full to make a profit, you can discount a lot, but you have to meet your fixed costs,\" he says.\nMore from the \nLuckily for the industry, oil prices have also collapsed during this downturn, and as fuel prices are one of cruise firms' biggest fixed costs, Prof Muller is certain of one thing: \"I can guarantee they are buying fuel futures like crazy\". \nIf David Reece and his wife Carolyn are anything to go by, the cruise line industry may well bounce back better than most.\nHe says that the ongoing coronavirus outbreak is \"not going to put us off at all\". He is instead looking forward to rescheduling their trip \"in the next 12 months\".\nDavid adds that he might also hunt for any special offers. \"We might go on a last minute cheapy\u2026 being retired we can drop tools and go anytime,\" he says.\nUK-based Cunard, part of Carnival, the world's largest cruise line operator, and owner of luxury ships including the Queen Mary 2, is also confident that the industry will recover.\n\"We have been sailing for 180 years and we look forward to many more,\" says Simon Palethorpe, Cunard's president. \"We will get through these tough times together and look forward to welcoming our guests back on board again soon, when the time is right.\"\nDavid adds that even if some smaller companies do go bust, the ships are unlikely to be wasted as they are worth billions. \"Someone will buy them up,\" he says.\nThe industry, it seems, will carry on cruising.\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52169825": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52169825", "title": "Coronavirus: What\u2019s life like when you're on furlough?", "published": "Tue, 07 Apr 2020 23:01:26 GMT", "summary": "With growing numbers of people being furloughed, how is this affecting them and their employers?", "story": "\"It really is a bit of a sticking plaster.

She volunteered for furlough because she knew not paying her salary would help the business in the long term. \n\"I feel terribly guilty for being at home, about being able to home-school without distraction,\" she says. \"But I know that because some work has stopped that we don't need a full cohort of staff.\" \n\"I still have my alarm on as if I'm going to work. I try and set myself a couple of goals each day to complete something, a course module for example. I also do a few things that bring me joy, like knitting.\"\nLike Natalie, Olivia is trying to make the best of her time off, taking part in online training courses.  \nBut losing their role in a business can take its toll on people's mental health. \nShe says she misses work, the daily conference calls and finds it hard not being around people.\nHuman resources expert Michaela Gartside believes keeping in touch with people while they are off work is vital.\n\"You have to remember they're sitting at home waiting for the next update, which they hope is: 'Come back to work',\" she says.\nRestaurant chain Honest Burgers has put in place a \"stay connected\" timetable for the 700 staff they have furloughed.\nMany of their staff are young, live alone and have family abroad, so this is to \"tackle some of the boredom but more importantly help with their mental wellbeing as well as their physical wellbeing\", according to co-founder Philip Eeles.  \nMany employees want the time off to look after their children now that nurseries and schools are closed.\nClaire Hastie is slowly recovering from Covid-19. \nA single mum of three, she was relieved when she volunteered to be put on furlough and her firm accepted the request. \n\"You don't want to feel the business can manage without you, but I need to see my children and concentrate on getting better,\" she says.\n\"The company is being amazing towards me, it has reduced me to tears.\"\nThis is allowed within the latest government guidelines, according to Diane Gilhooley, global head at the law firm Eversheds Sutherland, who points out \"furloughing people for Covid-19 related caring responsibilities starts to make it look more like an income protection scheme rather than a redundancy avoidance scheme\". \nThough employers around the country have embraced furloughing with enthusiasm, the speed at which it has been introduced has raised a number of issues. \nSome firms would like to see more flexibility, so they could make some team members part-time, with the government topping up their salary.\nOther firms would just like more information.\nMick Collins runs Secure Archive Solutions outside Manchester which stores and shreds legal documents. \nHe has furloughed four members of staff, leaving him and his wife to run the business. \nBut they feel rather in the dark by gaps in information, hoping - he says - that they're doing things by the book.\n\"We cannot do anything concrete until the government website for logging staff details is up and running. Our main thing is keeping the records bang on.\"\nEmployer or employee, it's the not knowing what might come after the pandemic subsides that is worrying many. \nAs Olivia puts it: \"Being on furlough is better than losing my job. But we don't know when recruitment will pick up - when confidence will pick up.\"\nNatalie says she has to believe everything will go back to business as usual. \"We know things will be different but I think we will learn good practices by having to adapt to this environment.\"\n\"It is strange times and anyone who's on furlough needs to hold on to the fact that they haven't been laid off and the company is trying to do everything they can to make sure they're not.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51837296": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51837296", "title": "Drones in Africa: How they could become lifesavers", "published": "Mon, 06 Apr 2020 23:24:38 GMT", "summary": "Rwanda's President Paul Kagame says drones will become important for his nation, but can they really deliver?", "story": "Death comes fast, says Temie Giwa-Tubosun, as we sit in the scorching sunshine of Rwanda's capital Kigali.\nShe's talking about post-partum haemorrhage - women bleeding after childbirth. \n\"I'm always amazed that more attention isn't paid to this - it's the biggest cause of death in childbirth\".\nTemie's company, Lifebank, delivers life-saving blood to hospitals in her home country of Nigeria, and elsewhere on the continent.\nUsually the blood is transported by road or on boats, but in Ethiopia some is moved by drone. \nMr Giwa-Tubosun is visiting Kigali for the first ever African Drone Forum at the shiny convention centre, which looks like a giant beehive crossed with a helter-skelter.\nIt glows like a rainbow at night, and is the jewel in the crown of modern Kigali, the fast-changing capital of a country which Rwanda's politicians time and again tell us is open for business. \nTechnology is front and centre of the government's plan to become a higher-middle-income country by 2050. It's an ambitious goal, given over 35% of the population lives in poverty, according to government statistics. \nBut it's one which President Paul Kagame is clearly keen to push. As he stands in front of the audience, he says that drones will become not just part of the Rwandan skies - he wants them manufactured and piloted by Rwandans.\nSchoolchildren watching hop up and down with excitement, hands shoot into the air when speakers talk about drone networks. \"I want to be a drone pilot,\" one girl, who can't be more than twelve, announces confidently. This is now one of the coolest jobs in Rwanda. \n\"In underdeveloped countries like Rwanda technology has to be adopted faster,\" says one college student called Benjamin. His classmate nods, she's studying engineering too. \"People don't know about drones, but the young can tell the older generation\" he adds. \nRwanda, the country of a thousand hills and slow, tediously winding roads, was the first in the world to embrace a commercial delivery service by drone when Silicon Valley firm Zipline began flying blood in 2016. \nIt received a huge amount of global publicity and has delivered tens of thousands of units of blood. But Zipline is an exception. Its flights are classified as government flights, meaning it has high-level exemptions when it comes to air traffic management.\nIt's the thorny issue of regulation and management of the lower airspace which all agree is key to the establishment of sustainable long-term drone delivery networks.\nTemie explains how her drivers have to learn the location of 400 hospitals by heart as the maps aren't accurate enough in a frantically urbanising city like Lagos, which is also clogged by traffic.\nDrones for her are just a way to get what's needed to patients faster. But, in Nigeria, they're not yet used for drops.\n\"The regulation isn't there yet,\" she says, but she and most people here believe that this will change, and that African skies, which are less congested than many parts of the world, will lead the way. But can it happen as quickly as many seem impatient to see, and should it?\nFreddie Mbuya, who owns the Tanzanian technology firm Uhurulabs, is a self-confessed nay-sayer.\n\"I don't think that delivery drones in Africa will be realistic in any meaningful way for the next decade. There's humanitarian need but no market opportunity.\"\n\"It exists now because of donor money and sponsorship.\"\nFor him, and his company, drones for mapping, and land surveying for clients such as miners are the most compelling use case.\nThe World Bank's Edward Anderson, who has focused on drones in the region, argues that they should be regarded as useful not just for medical deliveries. \n\"Rwanda is one of the most densely populated rural parts of the world. In the long run we're looking at drones providing economic opportunity in agriculture, for small-scale manufacturers, and to deliver time-sensitive goods such as cash and documents.\"\nA 90km drive from Kigali, taking over four-and-a-half stomach-churning hours, we arrive at a temporary drone port in a stunning spot by a bay of Lake Kivu, close to the border with the Democratic Republic of Congo. \nRwanda's rural areas are densely populated, but road infrastructure is inadequate. Most people walk miles up steep, high-sided hills, and the main road out of Kigali has a constant stream of foot traffic.\nThe lake is quiet, and still. A local fisherman tells us that's because of strict restrictions due to the neighbouring country's ongoing Ebola outbreak.\n\"The army says no,\" he says bluntly when we ask why there are so few boats, which would be a lot faster than roads to transport goods. \nThis is the Lake Kivu Challenge, the competition portion of the drone forum, and teams from around the world, mainly from Europe, are competing for contracts with the Rwandan government.\nIn a shed next to the hut where the little drones sit ready for their turn, we see mock-ups of blood transfusion bags and medical samples.\nThese will be picked up by the drones, dropped at a nearby island, then collected again within a certain time limit. \nSheltering in the shade we chat to Selina Herzog from German drone firm Wingcopter. It received a lot of attention last year for its vaccine drops on a remote island in Vanuatu in the Pacific. \"We have to make sure we aren't just coming into a country, running a short trial, then leaving again,\" she says.\nThis has been one of the biggest criticisms of cargo drone experiments, funded more often than not by humanitarian agencies for a very short duration. \n\"We're not there yet with regulators, countries have different rules, we have a lot to work out still.... and the question is, just who is going to pay for this?\" Ms Herzog asks.\nThis is something Lifebank's Temie Giwa is also passionate about.\n\"We have a moral responsibility to be cost-effective. We can't charge a developing country $250 (\u00a3204) for a drone delivery. [However] the only way to be sustainable is to be profitable.\"\nBack in Kigali, Temie remembers her own emergency caesarean, while she was in the US.\nShe believes the outcome could have been tragically different if she'd been back home in Nigeria, as it is for so many women.\n\"I get tearful every time I think about this, it is so solvable.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52200386": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52200386", "title": "Coronavirus: Six industries crying out for help", "published": "Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:52:15 GMT", "summary": "With the UK economy in crisis, many sectors are still demanding further help from the government.", "story": "As the coronavirus pandemic continues, more and more sectors of the economy are feeling the strain.\nAnd with banks under fire for denying emergency loans to some firms, it's hardly surprising that the UK's government is facing more calls for direct intervention.\nThe list covers big chunks of the country's infrastructure and vital transport links, but also other, less obvious economic areas that are no less important to society.\nBut all of them have one thing in common: they fear that the coronavirus crisis will inflict lasting damage on them.\nThe aviation industry was one of the first sectors to petition the government for a bailout. As country after country has imposed restrictions on travel in a bid to halt the spread of the virus, airlines have been seeking state aid to avoid going out of business for good.\nAt the end of last month, a group of 38 MPs wrote to Chancellor Rishi Sunak urging him to take steps to support airlines during the coronavirus pandemic.\nThe move was backed by the airline industry, with Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, saying: \"We are now entering the danger zone, and we urge government to change tack and start to engage on a sector-wide basis before it's too late.\"\nVirgin Atlantic, for one, has indicated that it intends to ask for a government bailout worth hundreds of millions of pounds.\nBut so far, Mr Sunak has said airlines should find other forms of funding and not turn first to the government.\nOther forms of transport are also facing tough times because of coronavirus. The road haulage industry, which moves goods from warehouses to shops across the country, is the latest to seek more help from the government.\nRichard Burnett, chief executive of the Road Haulage Association, told the BBC's Today programme that he was hopeful about the prospect of aid.\n\"Government are definitely recognising how critical and how important we are,\" he said. \"We are keeping the country fed at the moment.\"\nBut for one haulier, Andrew Howard, who owns Peterborough-based PC Howard, financial relief can't come soon enough. He said that because non-essential shops had been closed, the firm was moving fewer goods.\n\"We are now moving our lorries only partly loaded, typically two-thirds loaded,\" he told the Today programme, \"and that means we are losing money every single day, every time we send a vehicle out.\"\nFerry companies transport people and goods in and out of the UK. But because of the steep drop in passenger numbers, the firms are cutting back on services, putting essential supplies of food and medication at risk.\nThose suspending their passenger services include P&O Ferries, which carries about 15% of the UK's imported goods, including food and medicines. It is furloughing more than 1,000 staff, using the government's job retention scheme.\nP&O Ferries told the BBC that the company needs \u00a3257m to keep going. The BBC understands the company wants \u00a3150m of that to come from the government.\nBob Sanguinetti, chief executive of the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC: \"What we're asking for is not a wholesale bailout, it's for the government to share and underwrite some of the risk and the costs to allow the ferry companies to continue providing that vital, lifeline service to the country.\"\nAs manufacturers and construction firms shut down their operations, demand for steel has slumped. Industry group UK Steel has said that companies in the sector are \"fast approaching a cashflow crisis\".\nThe lobby group says many steel producers fall outside the scope of existing emergency loan schemes and need more specific help.\nRichard Warren, UK Steel's head of policy and representation, told the BBC: \"The key message is one of speed - we are looking for a solution that delivers the liquidity support as quickly as possible.\"\nHe called on the government to amend and expand its current schemes to ensure steel companies could access the support available.\nSpringtime is here - and in normal times, garden centres would be doing a roaring trade.\nBut with all non-essential shops closed down, all those plants and shrubs can't find their way to the public.\nThat's terrible news for plant growers, who are seeing their assets rot away in front of them.\nThe Horticultural Trades Association (HTA) has warned that up to a third of producers could go bust. It is asking the government for financial assistance of up to \u00a3250m to help the industry avoid collapse.\nNeil Alcock, managing director of Seiont Nurseries in north Wales, told the BBC that the firm had seen a downturn costing it about \u00a3100,000 worth of orders.\nHe added: \"We had sold thousands of plants, but then cancellations came in from everywhere. No ifs, no buts, the whole retail supply chain stopped for us.\"\nFrom food banks to mental health experts, the charitable sector is providing plenty of people with support in these troubled times.\nBut charities themselves are reeling from the financial impact of the crisis, with Oxfam and Age UK furloughing up to 70% of their staff during the coronavirus pandemic.\nCaron Bradshaw, chief executive of the Charity Finance Group, tweeted that the charity sector needed its own package of support from the government.\n\"Please recognise the impact losing charities - big and small - will have on our society,\" she said, adding that charities were \"essential to the fight to rebuild after this unprecedented disaster is over\".\n\"Charities are to society what bees are to the environment. We work away, often in the background, often unnoticed,\" she said.\nSo what yardstick should the government use when assessing these competing cries for help?\nRuss Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said that a good rule for government aid should be \"bailing out people, not bailing out companies\".\nHe acknowledged that the airline industry in particular had seen a \"frightening and spectacular\" collapse in demand, but added that people would argue that companies \"should have been prepared for at least some kind of downturn\".\n\"Maybe you do help companies out, but you do need to get to the point where shareholders and creditors have taken a hit first,\" he told the BBC.\n\"You can't look as though you're bailing out the 1% at the expense of the 99%.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52120399": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52120399", "title": "'We all have resilience...

This week we speak to professional explorer and motivational speaker Mike Horn.\n\"I was bitten by a snake and lost my eyesight, and all the feeling in my face. For five days I couldn't see.\"\nMike Horn, 53, is talking about his first major solo expedition, back in 1997, when he crossed South America, in part by swimming the length of the Amazon. \nThe gruelling six-month trip saw him brave rapids, break his knee going over a waterfall, have his equipment stolen by local tribespeople, and get shot at from the banks of the river. \nThe South African-born adventurer also had to hunt and forage for his food, and became a \"host for parasites\", having spent lengthy periods in the river. But he says the snakebite was the closest shave. \n\"I didn't know I was bitten until I felt the whole world turning in, and I started losing focus,\" says Mike, who in total travelled 7,000km (4,350 miles) from the Pacific coast of Peru to the Atlantic coast of Brazil. \n\"At that time I couldn't call back home, all I had was a personal locator beacon with 16 pre-coded messages that I could send to my wife. After three days it became so bad I was going to send the message 'I'm going to die', but I fell unconscious before I managed to push the button.\" \nBy the end of the trip Mike realised he wanted to be a professional explorer, and since then he has been on a series of increasingly gruelling adventures that have pushed him to the limit. \nThey include the first solo circumnavigation of the world around the equator with no engine-driven support in 1999, and becoming joint-first to trek to the North Pole on skis in 2006. He's also built a successful side career as a TV host and motivational speaker.  \nMike says he attempted his first expedition aged eight when, without telling anyone, he tried to cycle from his home in Johannesburg to his uncle's farm 300km away. \n\"I knew it was going to take time, I knew the distances that I could cover, and I was afraid that my dad would say no. But I wanted the freedom to try.\" \nWhen his father, a successful rugby player, realised what had happened, he drove and picked Mike up on the side of the road.\nDad wasn't angry. \"He just said, 'Tell me what you want to do and I can help you'\u2026 He always gave me the support to try something out of the ordinary.\"\nAfter a year of military service with the South African army, fighting in Angola, Mike completed a sports science degree at the University of Stellenbosch. Keen to get out of apartheid-era South Africa, in 1989, at the age of 24, he moved to Switzerland, his home to this day. \nThere he became ski instructor, but quickly tired of it, and so decided to embark on a series of mini-adventures in Peru. These included, in 1995, river-boarding through the Colca Canyon - one of the world's deepest canyons - where he braved daily avalanches.\nAs his trips became more ambitious, sponsors began to take notice, and Mr Horn found a way of funding his adventures. Today he counts a global car brand and a luxury Swiss watch as backers.\nHis exploring has also led to him writing 11 books, and starring in several TV shows. These included 2016's A L'Etat Sauvage - the French version of the US series Running Wild with Bear Grylls - in which the adventurer takes celebrities on trips with him. \nMost of Mike's expeditions have been done solo, with some - such as his 2002 voyage around the Arctic Circle by boat and kayak - lasting a year or more.\nHe says he \"loves the solitude\", but admits it was hard on his wife and manager of 20 years, Cathy, who died of breast cancer in 2015. It was also tough on their two daughters, who now run the business he set up in 2007 to manage his eponymous brand.\n\"There were years when I wasn't home for more than five days,\" he says, \"although I did fly them out for parts of my trips.\"\nMike has also risked his life more than once. For example, when he revisited the North Pole last year with fellow explorer Boerge Ousland, they crossed 1,800km of treacherous drifting ice on skis in the dark - in the Arctic winter there is no daylight.  \nMike got frostbite in his hands, and the explorers almost ran out of food. \"I thought I would never come back.\"\nHe has channelled such experiences into his work as a motivational speaker and coach, training the likes of the German football squad and big businesses on resilience.\n\"We all have resilience but we need it more or less depending on what we do in life and our social status\u2026 You've got to make it grow.\"\nHe also thinks many of us have too many options, that allow us to \"bail out of resilience\" and not confront our problems.\n\"Get rid of all the options, just decide to do one thing,\" says Mike. \"When I go to the North Pole, I know there's no rescue possible.\n\"There's no other option but to walk and make it. I can't bail out. That is when you become more determined to be able to stand up when you fall.\"\nMike says he has been slowing down since Cathy died, but his firm still employs five staff - down from 36 at its peak in 2012.\nAlistair Gowling, who runs Extreme International, a media company for adventure sports, says the South African adventurer has built his brand well, and helped to \"pave the way\" for a growing adventure tourism market. \n\"When [many] people go on holidays now they are looking to try something that drives their adrenalin, and that's largely thanks to people like Mike and Bear Grylls.\"\nThe challenge for today's adventurers, adds Mr Gowling, is coming up with new feats of endurance that grab people's increasingly swayable attention. \"The world has been explored and it's getting harder to move the needle.\"\nMike reckons he still has a couple of expeditions left in him, but he worries he is part of dying breed. \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52130592": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52130592", "title": "Madam CJ Walker: 'An inspiration to us all'", "published": "Sat, 04 Apr 2020 23:52:36 GMT", "summary": "How an African-American orphan and single mother founded a business empire - 114 years ago.", "story": "When American journalist A'Lelia Bundles published her first article about her great-great grandmother, Madam CJ Walker in 1982, it was in the \"lost women\" column of a women's magazine.\nThat marked quite a comedown for Mrs Walker, who founded a haircare business that made her the country's first self-made female millionaire -\"the world's wealthiest coloured woman, the foremost manufacturer and philanthropist of her race\", as one newspaper described her when she died in 1919. \nTo this day, Madam CJ Walker products can be purchased in stores - an unlikely legacy for a woman who toiled in poverty for decades and whose parents had been enslaved. \nBut \"for many years Madam Walker was just a little footnote in history. As a woman who made haircare products, she was really consigned to something trivial,\" says Ms Bundles, who published the first full-length biography of Mrs Walker, \"On Her Own Ground\" in 2001. \nNow, however, Ms Walker is \"having a moment\", as Ms Bundles put it in a recent blog post.\nHer story can be found in some 200 books, she's been featured in several recent museum exhibits, including at the Simthsonian in Washington DC,  and New York named a street in her honour last year. In March, Netflix released Self-made, a four-part series starring Octavia Spencer about her life and business, inspiring another publicity blitz - and the re-issuing of Ms Bundles' biography.\nMeanwhile, her brand has been revived by Unilever subsidiary Sundial Brands, known for its SheaMoisture hair products, which bought the rights in 2013. The foundation started by Sundial's founder, Richelieu Dennis, has also bought her 34-room New York mansion, Villa Lewaro, with plans to turn it into a think-tank for black women entrepreneurs. \n\"So much of her story is unfortunately still timely,\" says Elle Johnson, one of the writers of the Netflix series, of the buzz. \"When I look at her life and what she accomplished, I can't help but be amazed.\"\nBorn in Louisiana in 1867 as Sarah Breedlove, Mrs Walker was orphaned at age seven and a widowed mother by 20.  Her struggles with hair loss - a common problem at the time due to infrequent washing - inspired her to start her business, the Madam CJ Walker Manufacturing Co in 1906, which sold a \"treatment\" that included scalp massage and a special ointment. \nBy 1916, she employed more than 10,000 agents and ran a network of schools that trained women to enter the hair industry - one of the few ways outside of domestic work that black women could make money at that time. \n\"I had little or no opportunity when I started out in life . . . I had to make my own living and my own opportunity,\" she later recounted, according to Ms Bundles' biography. \"But I made it. That is why I want to say to every Negro woman present, don't sit down and wait for the opportunities to come, but you have to get up and make them!\"\nMrs Walker - who renamed herself after marrying her third husband, with the Madam added for branding purposes - was part of a wave of black entrepreneurs that emerged in the decades after slavery to meet the needs of a black population largely ignored by white business. \nThat included other African-American women with major haircare businesses, such as Annie Turnbo Malone, whose products Mrs Walker sold before developing her own formula. Their rivalry - which Ms Bundles says is exaggerated for dramatic effect - is a central point of the new Netflix series.\nBut Mrs Walker - whose life also inspired a Duke Ellington opera - remains the best known. That's in part testament to her marketing savvy, including her willingness to stamp her products with her own image - standard fare in the age of social influencers but a bold move when white beauty standards ruled the day.\n\"There were so many things that we think we invented or came out of Harvard Business School and this is something that this woman was doing 100 years ago,\" says Nicole Jefferson Asher, one of the writers of the Netflix show. \"It was her own innate business acumen.\" \nA frequent public speaker, Mrs Walker also spoke out on political issues like lynching and described the mission of her company in terms of female empowerment. Her obituaries recognised her for her philanthropy as well as her riches.\n\"Today we talk a lot about social entrepreneurship and businesses having a double bottom line or triple bottom line, [maximising social and environmental good as well as profits],\" says Tyrone Freeman, a professor of philanthropic studies at Indiana University, whose book about Mrs Walker's charitable work is due out this fall. \"I see Walker doing this 100 years ago.\"\nMs Asher says Mrs Walker's achievements made her a \"folk hero\" for generations of black women - even if she was often associated, incorrectly, with inventing the hot comb, a hair straightener.\nBut although her rags-to-riches tale seems made for the movies, until recently it was hard to get Hollywood to buy into stories focused on black stars, Ms Asher says, Now, at a time when America's economic divides are growing wider, racial and gender gaps are in the spotlight, and the power wielded by the country's business elite, through their companies and their philanthropy, is under scrutiny, the questions raised by her story resonate.\n\"This is a story about female entrepreneurship and the American dream and specifically the black American dream,\" she says. \"The more we learn about history, about this time period, will help us get through the time period we're currently struggling in right now.\"\nBut Mrs Walker's story is compelling in her own right, she adds. \"The example of that resilience and that determination and ambition really should be an inspiration to us all.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52125856": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52125856", "title": "My Money: 'People have started leaving their houses again'", "published": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 21:04:41 GMT", "summary": "As part of a BBC blog series, Jen Smith talks us through one week as pandemic restrictions ease in Shenzhen.", "story": "My Money is a series looking at how people spend their money - and the sometimes tough decisions they have to make.

It starts with one episode after dinner, blink, and suddenly it's 3am.

Well, those sites are banned unless you have a VPN - I pay \n a year for mine, so Sunday was a late night, with a lie-in until 10.30 this morning.\nI go for a run - mask and all, as it's currently illegal to be outside without one. I make my coffee (bought in the UK), fruit smoothie (about \n) and cereal (\n a packet) before cycling to work. \nToday is a bit of a crazy day in the studio. I work as a children's TV presenter. My company has profited from the lockdown as more children are watching the shows non-stop - meaning a rapid turnaround for us.\nWe shoot two shows from 2-6pm then \"break\" for a meeting. We discuss tomorrow's shoot while I eat dinner - homemade aubergine curry. It is normal for the Chinese to eat breakfast, lunch and dinner at work. Normally the company gives all staff 25 yuan through a food-ordering app, and the whole company would eat together. However, because of the current social distancing, that social time is in the far distant past!\nI make it home for 8pm, order some deep-fried cauliflower as a snack (\n) and start the inevitable Kardashian binge.\nTotal spend: \nIt's a much earlier start (7.30am), but the same morning routine. On my cycle to work I notice that the traffic is almost back to normal - Shenzhen is inhabited by well over 12 million people, so as you can imagine rush hour is intense. This doesn't change the fact that everywhere you go you have to scan a QR code - leaving my apartment, using the walkway by the river, and getting into the building I work in.\nAfter a morning of shooting I eat homemade potato curry and settle down for a nap. Naptime is such a commonality in China that people store camp beds at the office. I order a coffee and banana chips (\n) for a pick-me-up before the afternoon's shooting. \nIt's St Paddy's Day so I head to the local pubs area, catch dinner at a French restaurant (\n), then a few drinks (\n - mainly bought by men at the bar for us) before a very tipsy cycle home.\nTotal spend: \nThe morning's shoot (thankfully) was cancelled, so I nursed a hangover in bed until around 11am, at which point I had a phone meeting for a company that I do \"plus-size\" modelling for (for context I'm a UK size 12).

The poor editors, despite mandatory office hours during the week, then have to work tirelessly through the weekend to achieve a Sunday evening deadline. \nI start with mashed avocado and a hard-boiled egg before work. The morning shoot runs from 9.30-11.40am, and I have an early lunch - homemade curry again, before my regular nap time.

I was even refused entry to a building due to being foreign. I imagine this is because recently the only new cases are being brought in by non-Chinese travelling back to China.\nTotal spend: \nIt's another slow day for me as many foreigners have not yet returned to China, so most of my friends are out of the country.

The nation's time zone means its Apple stores are the first to open around the world on launch day.\nThis year could be different though. Like most other retailers, Apple has closed its shops around the world in response to the coronavirus outbreak. \nIt's still too early to say whether the shops will be back open in the time for the launch of new devices in the autumn.\nBut in some countries the picture is not encouraging. In the UK, the government has said that it could be between three to six months before normal life will resume and that includes re-opening non-essential shops.\nIn the case of Apple, it has its iPhone 12 waiting in the wings. It's a particularly important phone, as it's the first to incorporate 5G technology, allowing it to connect with the new generation of faster phone networks.   \nSources have told the Japanese publication Nikkei that Apple is weighing up whether to delay that launch.\nThe same may be true for devices manufactured by Samsung and other rivals that use the Android operating system.\nProduction of phones has already been disrupted, \n\"Approximately 70% of smartphones are manufactured in China - so as the pandemic hit China, there has been significant disruption to the supply of existing devices,\" says Razat Gaurav, chief executive of Llamasoft, a supply chain analytics company. \nMany smartphone makers rely on components that are made in China and South Korea, two nations that have been hardest hit by the outbreak. \nThe South Korean city of Daegu, where most of the country's coronavirus cases are clustered, is only 20 minutes away from the area where many of those components are produced. \nAnd it's not just supply, demand has fallen dramatically. Shipments of smartphones in China tumbled by 40% in the first quarter of 2020, compared with the same period last year, according to research firm IDC.\nThe company suggests that Chinese consumers will buy 33 million fewer phones in the first three months of the year. \n\"We're likely to see significant drops in Western Europe and the US as well,\" Gaurav adds.\nThe effect on existing devices will be a worry for device manufacturers, but it will be the impact on their new devices which will be of greater concern, particularly as fans of Apple and Android devices are accustomed to specific times of the year when they can buy a new device, while manufacturers rely on this as one of the biggest revenue streams every year.\n\"The smartphone is a complicated product, and there are so many components that go into it. In order to source all of those different parts, you're getting materials and parts from about 40 different countries,\" says Gaurav. \nDifferent parts of the production process will be affected in different ways. \n\"Much of the design work does not require significant social contact, meaning you don't have to be in physical proximity to people,\" says Frank Gillett, an analyst at research firm Forrester.\nBut there may be some research and development work which requires specialised equipment that employees can't take home. \nA lot of this work would have already been carried out for devices set to launch this year, but it could hinder device launches in 2021, which companies are already working on ahead of time.\nAccording to Emile Naus, partner at consultancy BearingPoint, the most important part of the phone is not the hardware, it's the software, and this can be developed remotely. However, testing the device may be harder to carry out. \n\"Testing may be hard as the industry is very tight on security and they would probably struggle with the concept of people taking home prototypes of the phone to test - as these are usually shrouded in secret,\" he says.\nThe other issue is around shipping; with many airlines suspending flights and delays with ocean freight, there is a chance that materials and components may not get to assembly plants, and that the finished product does not get to retail outlets.\nThe effects of this and the China factory shutdowns are only now starting to ripple down into the smartphone industry, and the impact could be bigger than expected.\nMr Gillett believes that the likes of Apple and Samsung are more likely to hold back on certain features for new devices than delay launches. The time to get certain features tested, or for software developers to be able to work on applications that make use of these features, is critical.\nMuch obviously depends on what happens in the coming months. Restrictions on delivery and shipping might force firms to delay product launches, and possibly launches may even be held back until 2021.  \nIf shops stay closed then this could be a particular problem for Apple, which has an important retail network.\n\"We know that the first weeks and months of these new devices' sales life are very important because they're sold at the highest levels,\" says Mr Naus. \nDemand for the new devices may also falter, as spending serious amounts of money on the latest model may not be an option for householders going through financial difficulties. \nBut Forrester does not see brands making big changes to the price of their new handsets. Instead it thinks they may cut prices further on their older models, and perhaps bolster the number of entry-level priced-models available. \nPrices may not come down - but if the demand is not there, then perhaps new strategies could be put into place.\n\"What you might also see are some creative pricing models to make it feel more affordable and responsive to people's situations. Perhaps there will be a temporary promotion to help people out at a lower price if they can show an unemployment cheque or an emergency services ID,\" says Mr Gillett. \nHowever, Apple's biggest fans are likely to remain loyal.\n\"I don't think [the pandemic] will impact interest, especially amongst consumers because we're always buying new things: right now the big thing is toilet paper but eventually it'll go back to being iPhones,\" says Mr Kourouche. \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}}, "science": {"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52312260": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52312260", "title": "Climate change: US megadrought 'already under way'", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 18:21:53 GMT", "summary": "A drought as bad as any in recorded history may be under way in the US.", "story": "A drought, equal to the worst to have hit the western US in recorded history, is already under way, say scientists.\nResearchers say the megadrought is a naturally occurring event that started in the year 2000 and is still ongoing.\nClimate change, though, is having a major impact with rising temperatures making the drought more severe.\nSome researchers are more cautious, saying that it is too early to say if the region really is seeing a true megadrought. \nAccording to the authors of this new paper, a megadrought in North America refers to a multi-decade event, that contains periods of very high severity that last longer than anything observed during the 19th or 20th centuries. \nThe authors say there have been around 40 drought events over the period from 800-2018 in the western US. \nOf these, only four meet the criteria for a megadrought. \nThese were in the late 800s, the mid-1100s, the 1200s and the late 1500s.\nThe key to this new study is the use of tree ring records to reconstruct soil moisture data for the past 1200 years. \nThe team were also able to use supporting evidence such as medieval tree stumps growing in normally wet river beds, the abandonment of settlements by indigenous civilisations at the peak of the 13th century drought, plus evidence from lake deposits indicating wildfire activity was enhanced during these drought periods. \nThe researchers discovered that when they compared the worst 19-year drought events in the past to soil moisture records from 2000-2018, the current period is already worse than three of the four megadroughts recorded.\nThe fourth one, which ran from 1575 to 1603 was likely the worst one of all, but the difference with the present event is slight. \n\"The first two decades of this drought look just like the first two decades of all of the mega droughts,\" said lead author Dr Park Williams, from Columbia University in New York.\n\"In fact, it is essentially tied with the worst two decades of the worst of the mega droughts.\"\nThe authors say that undoubtedly the current drought situation is a natural event but is being made much worse by climate change. \nThe key event seems to have been the El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a weather phenomenon.\n\"We know from, from many lines of evidence that when you have La Ni\u00f1a type conditions in the tropical Pacific Ocean, then the southwestern US and northern Mexico get dry. And that's what we've seen over the last two decades,\" said Dr Williams.\nBut climate change has super-charged the current drought.\nThe authors say that in the western US, temperatures have gone up by 1.2C since 2000. Hotter air holds more moisture and that moisture is being pulled out of the ground.\nThey believe that climate change is responsible for about half of of the pace and severity of the current event. \n\"It doesn't matter if this is exactly the worst drought ever,\" said co-author Benjamin Cook, who is affiliated with Columbia University and Nasa's Goddard Institute for Space Studies.\n\"What matters is that it has been made much worse than it would have been because of climate change.\"\nThe authors say the two most important water reservoirs in the region, Lake Powell and Lake Mead have both shrunk dramatically during the drought. Wildfires across the region are growing in area. \n\"At any given year, there's over ten times more forest area burns than we would have expected in a given year, 40 years ago,\" said Dr Williams. \nWhat has helped to mitigate the impact of the drought has been groundwater - the water held underground in aquifers.\nThis has increasingly been used to bolster supplies for agriculture. \nThe longer the drought goes on, the deeper into these reserves that people are digging, and they take a long time to replenish.\nNo. This new study is contentious, especially as the definition of what exactly a megadrought means is still being argued over. \nSome say that it is also way too early to declare that a megadrought is ongoing.\nBut even those who disagree with the idea, acknowledge there is water stress in the region and this is likely to get worse in the future. \n\"Whether or not the western US has crossed a threshold into an event that goes by any specific label, what's been clear this century is that water is an essential resource in the western US, and it's a precarious one, because the region can have long spells with little precipitation,\" said Dr Angeline Pendergrass, a scientist with the US National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).\n\"And it looks like climate change won't make it better - indeed, it will likely make it worse.\"\nThe study has been published in the journal Science. \nFollow Matt \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52318539": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52318539", "title": "Coronavirus: Is there any evidence for lab release theory?", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 21:10:58 GMT", "summary": "BBC News examines allegations that the coronavirus was accidentally released from a lab.", "story": "US State Department cables show that embassy officials were worried about biosecurity at a virus lab in Wuhan, China. The lab is in the same city where the coronavirus outbreak first came to the world's attention.\nAnd President Donald Trump has said the US government is looking into unverified reports that the virus escaped from a laboratory.\nSo what, if anything, does this add to our understanding of the current pandemic?\nThe Washington Post newspaper has reported information obtained from diplomatic cables. They show that, in 2018, US science diplomats were sent on repeated visits to a Chinese research facility. Officials \nThe column says the officials were worried about safety and management weaknesses at the Wuhan Institute of Virology (WIV) and called for more help.\nIt also claims diplomats were concerned the lab's research on bat coronaviruses could risk a new Sars-like pandemic. The newspaper says the cables fuelled more recent discussions in the US government about whether the WIV or another lab in Wuhan could have been the source of the virus behind the current pandemic.\nIn addition, Fox News has also issued \nThe outbreak came to light late last year when early cases were linked to a food market in Wuhan. But despite rampant online speculation, there is no evidence of any kind that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (which causes Covid-19) was released accidentally from a lab.\nLaboratories studying viruses and bacteria follow a system known as the BSL standards, where BSL stands for Biosafety Level.\nThere are four levels, which depend on the types of biological agents being studied and the containment precautions needed to isolate them.\nBiosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) is the lowest and is used by labs studying well-known biological agents that pose no threat to humans.\nThe containment precautions increase through the levels until you arrive at Biosafety Level 4 (BSL-4) which is the highest, and reserved for labs dealing with the most dangerous pathogens for which there are few available vaccines or treatments: ebola, Marburg virus and - in the case of just two institutes in the US and Russia - smallpox.\nThe BSL standards are applied internationally, but with some cosmetic variations.\n\"The Russians, for instance, label their highest containment labs as 1 and the lowest containment labs as 4, so the exact opposite of the standard, but the actual practices and infrastructure requirements are similar,\" says Dr Filippa Lentzos, a biosecurity expert at King's College London.\nBut while the World Health Organization (WHO) sent two warnings to Washington about inadequate safety at the lab., the standards are not enforced by any treaties.\n\"They've been developed to be in the best interest for working safely, for lab workers who don't want to infect themselves or their community, and for the environment to avoid accidental releases,\" says Dr Lentzos.\nBut she adds: \"The 'stick' comes with the purse strings. If you want to do projects with international partners they require labs to be operating to certain standards. Or if you have products to sell in the market, or perform certain services, e.g. tests, then you are also required to operate to international standards.\"\nIndeed, the WIV had received funding from the US, along with assistance from American research institutes. The cables recommended giving them even more help.\nThe short answer is that we don't know from the information provided in the Washington Post. But, generally-speaking, there are multiple ways that safety measures can be breached at labs dealing with biological agents.\nAccording to Dr Lentzos, these include: \"Who has access to the lab, the training and refresher-training of scientists and technicians, procedures for record-keeping, signage, inventory lists of pathogens, accident notification practices, emergency procedures.\"\nBut how unusual were the concerns expressed in the diplomatic cables?\nAccidents happen. In 2014, forgotten a report promoting the lab origin theory. in a research centre near Washington. In 2015, the US military accidentally has published a manual on the different levels instead of dead spores to as many as nine labs across the country and a military base in South Korea.  \nThere are variations in safety standards across the large number of labs at the lower end of the BSL scale and many lesser breaches don't make it into the news.\nBut there are relatively few labs that are designated BSL-4. Wikipedia lists over 50 around the world, of which WIV was one, but there is no authoritative list.\nThey have to be built to very high specifications because they deal with the most dangerous pathogens known to science. As a result, they generally have good safety records. So any concerns about procedures at one of these facilities would be more than noteworthy.\nYes, almost as soon as the novel coronavirus came to light, there was speculation - much of it uninformed - about its origins.\nOne online theory, that went viral in January, suggested the virus could have been engineered in a lab as a bioweapon. This allegation has been repeatedly dismissed by scientists, who vials of smallpox were found in a cardboard box - most likely in bats. \nViruses can also be engineered for the purposes of fundamental scientific research. For example, gain of function studies may improve the ability of a pathogen to cause disease, to investigate how viruses could mutate in future.\nBut a US study of the coronavirus genome published in March shipped live anthrax samples. \"By comparing the available genome sequence data for known coronavirus strains, we can firmly determine that SARS-CoV-2 originated through natural processes,\" co-author Kristian Andersen, from Scripps Research in California, said at the time.\nThen there is the allegation of an accidental release of a natural virus from a lab. The proximity of the Wuhan seafood market, where the outbreak came to light, to at least two institutes carrying out research on infectious diseases fuelled speculation about a link.\nThat the WIV had carried out research on bat coronaviruses is a matter of public record. This work was entirely legitimate and published in international journals. Given the country's experience with the Sars outbreak in the early 2000s, this should come as no surprise. \nDr Lentzos said the issue of its origin was a \"very difficult question\", and added that \"there have been quiet, behind-the-scene discussions... in the biosecurity expert community, questioning the seafood market origin that has come out very strongly from China\".\nBut there is currently no evidence that any research institute in Wuhan was the source of Sars-CoV-2.\nOn Thursday, China foreign ministry spokesman Zhao Lijian note that studies show the virus originated in animals, telling journalists the World Health Organization's officials \"have said multiple times there is no evidence the new coronavirus was created in a laboratory\".\nPresident Donald Trump, who has been coming under fire over his administration's response to the pandemic, said that the US government is investigating the lab theory. \nChina has repeatedly been accused of lacking transparency in the early stages of the outbreak, and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has said Beijing \"needs to come clean\" on what they know.\nAmid this war of words between the countries, the painstaking - and largely unseen - scientific work to trace the origin of the virus will continue.\nFollow Paul \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52329498": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52329498", "title": "Chernobyl wildfire blankets Kyiv in thick smog", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 16:37:49 GMT", "summary": "Ukraine's capital is now among the world's most polluted cities, an international ranking shows.", "story": "Acrid smoke from a wildfire near the defunct Chernobyl nuclear plant has blanketed Ukraine's capital Kyiv, making its air pollution among the worst in the world.\nKyiv's pollution now ranks alongside that of several Chinese cities, \nThe coronavirus lockdown is keeping most Kyiv residents at home anyway.\nUkraine's health ministry says the radiation level remains normal and Chernobyl faces no immediate threat.\nAt one point on Thursday, according to the IQAir index, Kyiv's air pollution was the worst in the world.\nBut the dramatic global slump in economic activity, caused by the coronavirus pandemic, has made the air in many cities cleaner.

When this information is combined with data about the mass of the object - obtained through other means - it will be possible for scientists to deduce a density.\nAnd this should say a lot about the composition and internal structure of the target.\nKelt-11b has provided a good early demonstration. This is a giant exoplanet some 30% larger than our own Jupiter that orbits very close to a star called HD 93396. Kelt-11b is a seemingly \"puffed up\" world with a very low density - hence the comparison with expanded foam.\nFrom the way the light from the star dips when Kelt-11b moves in front to make its transit, Cheops' exquisite photometer instrument is able to determine the planet's diameter to be 181,600km (plus or minus 4,290km). This measurement is over five times more precise than was possible using a ground-based telescope.\nThe European Space Agency (Esa) is part of the collaboration behind Cheops. Its project scientist Dr Kate Isaak lauded the performance of the new observatory.\n\"We have a very stable satellite; the pointing is excellent - better than requirements. And this is going to be a real benefit to the mission,\" she told BBC News.\n\"From the spacecraft side, from the instrument side, from the analysis of the data that we're getting - we can see that this mission has huge promise.\"\nProf David Ehrenreich from the University of Geneva said quite a few early observations made with Cheops would be of \"super-Earths\".\n\"These are planets that are assumed to be rocky like Earth - but much bigger, more massive. And much hotter, too. Lava worlds,\" he explained. \n55 Cancri-e fits into this category. More than eight times as massive as Earth, it takes just 18 hours to circle its parent star. Scientists believe it to have a global ocean of molten rock on its surface. \nAbout 80% of observing time on Cheops is reserved for the project consortium. Led from the universities of Bern and Geneva, this team has members in eleven European nations (with Esa as a partner also). The other 20% of time is being offered to the community at large. And the first of these external proposals will be studied in coming days. Cheops will look at a burnt-out, or white dwarf, star to see if there is any planetary material moving around it.\nNobel Laureate Prof Didier Queloz, from the universities of Cambridge and Geneva, said the goal of Cheops was to improve our ideas for how planets were created.  \nHe told the BBC: \"We have built a whole theory of planet formation by observing only the eight planets of our Solar System, but by extending our observations to other kinds of planets that have no counterpart in our Solar System - we should be able to add the missing parts of this theory and get, let's say, a bigger perspective on how we actually fit in.\"\nScience planning for Cheops is run out of the Geneva; the telescope itself is controlled from Spain, at the National Institute for Aerospace Technology in Torrejon on the outskirts of Madrid.\nWhile the coronavirus crisis has meant considerable disruption for many space projects, Cheops has been largely unaffected.\n\"The completion of the test phase was only possible with the full commitment of all the participants, and because the mission has an operational control system that is largely automated, allowing commands to be sent and data to be received from home,\" said Prof Willy Benz from the University of Bern and principal investigator on the mission.\nCheops is a short form that stands for CHaracterising ExOPlanet Satellite.\n and follow me on Twitter: \nCheops was launched in December\n@BBCAmos\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52297058": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52297058", "title": "Biggest cosmic mystery 'step closer' to solution", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 05:50:51 GMT", "summary": "New experimental findings could help us solve one of the biggest mysteries about the Universe.", "story": "Stars, galaxies, planets, pretty much everything that makes up our everyday lives owes its existence to a cosmic quirk.\nThe nature of this quirk, which allowed matter to dominate the Universe at the expense of antimatter, remains a mystery.\nNow, results from an experiment in Japan could help researchers solve the puzzle - one of the biggest in science.\nIt hinges on a difference in the way matter and antimatter particles behave.\nThe world that's familiar to us - including all the everyday objects we can touch - is made up of matter. The fundamental building blocks of matter are sub-atomic particles, such as electrons, quarks and neutrinos.\nBut matter has a shadowy counterpart called antimatter. Each sub-atomic particle of ordinary matter has a corresponding \"antiparticle\".\nToday, there is far more matter than antimatter in the Universe. But it wasn't always this way.\nThe Big Bang should have created matter and antimatter in equal amounts.\n\"When particle physicists make new particles in accelerators, they always find that they produce particle-antiparticle pairs: for every negative electron, a positively charged positron (the electron's antimatter counterpart),\" said Prof Lee Thompson from the University of Sheffield, a member of the 350-strong T2K collaboration, which includes a relatively large number of scientists from UK universities.\n\"So why isn't the universe 50% antimatter? This is a long-standing problem in cosmology - what happened to the antimatter?\"\nHowever, when a matter particle meets its antiparticle, they \"annihilate\" - disappear in a flash of energy.\nDuring the first fractions of a second of the Big Bang, the hot, dense Universe was fizzing with particle-antiparticle pairs popping in and out of existence. Without some other, unknown mechanism at play, the Universe should contain nothing but leftover energy.\n\"It would be pretty boring and we wouldn't be here,\" Prof Stefan S\u00f6ldner-Rembold, head of the particle physics group at the University of Manchester, told BBC News.\nSo what happened to tip the balance?\nThat's where the T2K experiment comes in. T2K is based at the Super-Kamiokande neutrino observatory, based underground in the Kamioka area of Hida, Japan.\nResearchers used the facility's detector to observe neutrinos and their antimatter counterparts, antineutrinos, generated 295km away at the Japanese Proton Accelerator Research Complex (J-Parc) in Tokai. T2K stands for Tokai to Kamioka. \nAs they travel through the Earth, the particles and antiparticles oscillate between different physical properties known as flavours. \nPhysicists think that finding a difference - or asymmetry - in the physical properties of neutrinos and antineutrinos might help us understand why matter is so prevalent compared with antimatter. This asymmetry is known as charge-conjugation and parity reversal (CP) violation.\nIt is one of three necessary conditions, proposed by the Russian physicist Andrei Sakharov in 1967, that must be satisfied to produce matter and antimatter at different rates.\nAfter analysing nine years' worth of data, the researchers found a mismatch in the way neutrinos and antineutrinos oscillate by recording the numbers that reached Super Kamiokande with a flavour different from the one they had been created with.\nThe result has also reached a level of statistical significance - called three-sigma - that's high enough to indicate that CP violation occurs in these particles.\nThe results have been \n\"While CP violation involving quarks is experimentally well established, CP violation has never been observed for neutrinos,\" said Stefan S\u00f6ldner-Rembold.\n\"The violation of CP symmetry is one of the (Sakharov) conditions for a matter-dominated Universe to exist, but the quark-driven effect is unfortunately much too small to explain why our Universe is mainly filled with matter.\n\"Discovering CP violation with neutrinos would be a great leap forward in understanding how the Universe was formed.\"\nHe said a theory called leptogenesis links the dominance of matter to CP violation involving neutrinos. \"These leptogenesis models predict that the matter domination is actually due to the neutrino sector. If you were to observe neutrino CP violation, that would give us a strong indication that the leptogenesis model is the way forward,\" said Prof S\u00f6ldner-Rembold.\nThe results from T2K \"give strong hints\" that the CP violation effect could be large for neutrinos.\nThis would mean that published in the journal Nature., which is currently being constructed in a mine in South Dakota, might detect the effect faster than expected. The international project is being hosted by the US Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab).\nProf S\u00f6ldner-Rembold is a member of the DUNE scientific team and the collaboration's spokesperson. The experiment's detector will contain 70,000 tons of liquid argon buried one mile underground. It will be used to discover and measure CP violation with high precision. \nHe added that the T2K result \"brings us a step closer to having a model that explains how the Universe evolved from the beginning to the matter-dominated Universe today\".\nFollow Paul \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52300360": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52300360", "title": "Coronavirus: Space crew return to very different Earth", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 06:02:19 GMT", "summary": "No strangers to isolation, the trio left for the space station months before Covid-19 emerged.", "story": "A crew of three has returned from the International Space Station (ISS) to a very different planet they left last year.\nNo strangers to isolation, Russian Oleg Skrypochka and Jessica Meir from the US left Earth in September 2019, well before Covid-19 emerged.\nAnother American, Andrew Morgan, has been on the ISS since July 2019.\nThe coronavirus pandemic has changed the usual routine for returning space crews.\n\"It's quite surreal to see it unfolding on Earth below,\" Ms Meir told reporters during a recent video call. \"From here, Earth looks just as stunning as usual, so it's hard to believe all of the changes that have taken place since we left.\"\nThe trio touched down on Earth at 05:16 GMT, with Mr Skrypochka and Ms Meir having spent 205 days in space, and Mr Morgan 272 days.A series of posts on the official ISS Twitter account described how the crew's Soyuz ship split into three modules before the descent module reached the Earth's atmosphere \"creating a plasma trail\" early on Friday. \nThe capsule then landed successfully in Kazakhstan.

At present there is no cure for the infection. \nIt can infect cherry, almond and plum trees as well as olives. \nIt has become closely associated with olives after a strain was discovered in trees in Puglia in Italy in 2013. \nThe organism is transmitted by sap-sucking insects such as spittlebugs. \nThe infection limits the tree's ability to move water and nutrients and over time it withers and dies. \nIn Italy, the consequences of the spread of the disease have been devastating, with an estimated 60% decline in crop yields since the first discovery in 2013. \n\"The damage to the olives also causes a depreciation of the value of the land, and to the touristic attractiveness of this region,\" said Dr Maria Saponari, from the CNR Institute for Sustainable Plant Protection in Italy.\n\"It's had a severe impact on the local economy and jobs connected with agriculture.\"\nAs well as in Italy, the Xylella bacterium has now been found in Spain, France and Portugal. \nTackling it at present involves removing infected trees and trying to clamp down on the movement of plant material and the insects that spread the disease.\nBut if these measures fail, what will be the financial impact of the infection? \nIn study has been published researchers modelled different scenarios including what would happen if all growing ceased due to tree death. \nThey also compared this worst case with a scenario where replanting with resistant varieties occurred. \nThe team made projections for Italy, Spain and Greece, which between them account for 95% of European olive oil production.\nIn Spain, if the infection expanded and the majority of trees became infected and died, the costs could run to \u20ac17 billion over the next 50 years. \nA similar scenario in Italy would amount to over five billion, while in Greece, the losses would be under two billion.\nIf the rate of infection is slowed down, or resistant varieties are planted instead, then these costs would be significantly reduced. \nHowever, the authors believe, whatever happens, there will likely be a knock-on impact on consumers. \n\"The expected effect could be that there would be a shortage of supply,\" said lead author Kevin Schneider from Wageningen University in the Netherlands. \n\"And I would expect that if prices go up, consumers will be worse off.\"\nThe authors say that while their analysis looks at economics, there are also potentially large touristic and cultural losses caused by the bacterium that can't be ignored. \n\"You really hear devastating stories of infected orchards that were inherited over generations,\" said Dr Schneider. \n\"It's the same orchard that their grandparents were once working on. So how do you put an economic number on the loss of something like this. The cultural heritage value would be far larger than we could compute.\"\nThere are a growing number of scientific initiatives to try and take the fight to the bacterium, including using insect repelling clays, vegetative barriers and genetic analysis to determine why some plants are more susceptible to the infection than others. \nUltimately, the researchers believe that beating the pathogen will require trees that are resistant to the disease. \n\"Seeking resistant cultivars or immune species is one of the most promising, and environmentally sustainable, long-term control strategies to which the  European scientific community is devoting relevant research efforts,\" said Dr Saponari,\n\"Sustainable strategies to reduce the population of the insects is the other pillar for the control of the vector-borne disease, in this regard, mechanical intervention to remove weeds in spring is one of the most efficacious applications to reduce the populations of the insect, indeed several other strategies are also being studied to implement the control of the insects,\" she added. \nWhile two varieties of olive tree have been found to have some resistance, the authors are calling for research in this area to be significantly boosted. \nThe on Twitter. in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\nFollow Matt \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52277414": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-52277414", "title": "Chernobyl fire under control, Ukraine officials say", "published": "Tue, 14 Apr 2020 10:18:35 GMT", "summary": "Firefighters are tackling remaining \"hot spots\" near the abandoned nuclear plant, officials say.", "story": "A fire that threatened the abandoned Chernobyl nuclear plant has been contained, Ukrainian authorities said. \nEmergency services said on Tuesday there were still some \"smouldering\" parts of the forest floor, but there was \"no open fire\" left.\nThere had been fears the blaze could threaten the site of the 1986 nuclear catastrophe.\nGreenpeace Russia said on Monday one blaze was just one kilometre from the plant itself.\nThough fires are common in the area, Greenpeace said this was the worst in decades.

This seems to act as an effective disincentive.\nMelbourne city officials also operate a considerable planting programme, with about 3,000 new trees being put into the ground each year.\n\"This offsets the losses somewhat,\" observed Mr Croeser, \"although replacing a 20-year-old tree with a sapling definitely is not the same, the sheer volume of planting helps.\"\nMelbourne is well-known as a tree city. Officials had tagged every tree in the city and gave each one an individual email address. The scheme was set up so that people could report problems or concerns. Instead, people sent affectionate notes to the gums, oaks and elms.\nWhile some cities are supportive of trees, and the benefits they provide - such as mitigating the urban heat island effect, providing habitats for insects, animals and birds, and improving our sense of wellbeing - other cities have fallen foul of angry protesters and residents.\nSheffield, in the UK, is considered to be one of the nation's greener cities. Yet the council undertook a widespread programme of street tree removals in 2017.\nThe strategy of the council's \"Streets Ahead\" strategy - under which about 5,500 trees have been removed since 2012 and replaced with saplings - said that felling was only considered as a \"last resort\". \nBut residents and protesters said that trees that did not need to be felled were being cut down. Tensions and tempers rose. Protests were staged. People were arrested.\nThe stand-off resulted in widespread media coverage. An investigation by the UK's local government ombudsman found that Sheffield council had misled residents. The council accepted the findings and issued apologies to the residents.\nTree canopy cover in England's towns and cities is, on average, 16%. A citizen science project, Forest Research - in partnership with Trees for Cities and Brillianto - found that the cover in 283 urban conurbations ranged from 3% to 45%.\nExplaining the motivation for the UK-wide map of urban tree cover, Forest Research said: \"Urban trees are being increasingly recognised for the many benefits they provide, such removing carbon dioxide and pollutants from the air, providing habitats for wildlife, and making our urban areas more attractive, enjoyable and healthy places to be.\"\nAs the issue of climate change forms a central pillar of government policies, many cities are setting targets to boost their urban tree canopy cover.\nIn the last UK General election, the government - in its manifesto - pledged to plant an additional 75,000 acres of trees each year by \"the next Parliament\" - in other words, by 2024. In order to deliver this ambitious target, councils in urban areas would be expected to help deliver this goal.\nAt the World Forum on Urban Trees, held in Italy during 2018, delegates issued a call for action to highlight the benefits of trees in cities.\nMore than half of the world's population now live in urban areas, and this is forecast to grow to 68% by the middle of the 21st Century.\nWhile is it widely accepted that tree cover can improve people's daily wellbeing, Thami Croeser said the Melbourne study highlighted a few factors for tree officers around the globe.\n\"Many cities measure the number of trees they plant as their main target for urban forests,\" he told BBC News.\n\"That's not actually the real challenge; it a matter of planting them \n keeping them alive and healthy.\"\nHe said that tree canopy targets were a good idea because they focused \"on the cover that trees give us, rather than planting numbers.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52286165": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52286165", "title": "Climate change: Blue skies pushed Greenland 'into the red'", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 13:30:18 GMT", "summary": "Cloud-free skies played a key role in one of the worst years for Greenland's ice sheet.", "story": "researchers reported that the Greenland ice sheet was melting seven times faster While high temperatures were critical to the melting seen in Greenland last year, scientists say that clear blue skies also played a key role. \nIn a study, they found that a record number of cloud free days saw more sunlight hit the surface while snowfall was also reduced.\nThese conditions were due to wobbles in the fast moving jet stream air current that also trapped heat over Europe. \nAs a result, Greenland's ice sheet lost an estimated 600 billion tonnes.\nCurrent climate models don't include the impact of the wandering jet stream say the authors, and may be underestimating the impact of warming.\nGreenland's ice sheet is seven times the area of the UK and up to 2-3km thick in places. It stores so much frozen water that if the whole thing melted, it would raise sea levels worldwide by up to 7m.\nLast December, The Cryosphere than it had been during the 1990s. \nIn recent weeks, an analysis of last year's melting said the 600 billion tonnes of ice added 2.2mm to global sea levels in just two months.\nThis new study says that while rising global temperatures played a role in the events last year, changes in atmospheric circulation patterns were also to blame. \nResearchers found that high pressure weather conditions prevailed over Greenland for record amounts of time. \nThey believe this is connected to what's termed the \"waviness\" in the jet stream, the giant current of air that mostly flows from west to east around the globe.\nAs the current becomes more wobbly, it bends north, and high pressure systems that would normally move through in a few days become \"blocked' over Greenland.\nThese systems had different impacts depending on the part of Greenland you were in.\nIn the southern part of the island, the authors say, it caused clearer skies with more sunlight hitting the surface. \nThe cloud-free days brought less snow, which meant that 50 billion fewer tonnes were added to the ice sheet. \nThe absence of snow also exposed bare, dark ice in some place which absorbed more heat - contributing to the melt. \nIn other parts of Greenland, the changing atmospheric patterns had different but equally damaging impacts.\nIn northern and western region, the swirling but stuck high pressure systems pulled in warm air from southern latitudes. \n\"You can imagine that a sort of vacuum cleaner that is spinning clockwise and sucking all the warm and moist air from New York City for example,\" said lead author Dr Marco Tedesco from Columbia University in New York, US.\n\"And because of the rotation, it deposits this warm, moist air high in the northern part. It forms clouds, and they behave like a greenhouse, trapping the heat that would normally radiate off the ice.\"\nDr Tedesco explained that Greenland in 2019 experienced the largest drop in surface mass balance since records began in 1948. \nThe term surface mass balance describes the overall state of the ice sheet after accounting for gains from snowfall and losses from surface melt-water run-off.\nThe authors believe their study explains why, despite the fact that 2019 was not as warm as 2012, last year produced a record drop in surface mass balance. \n\"This is really pushing Greenland into the red,\" said Dr Tedesco. \nOther researchers working in this field agreed that the new paper is a good explanation of what happened last year in Greenland. \n\"The main message of the paper is that the very high melt was mostly driven by clear skies and direct melting rather than necessarily being attributable to unusually high temperatures over the ice sheet - a radiatively-driven, rather than thermally-driven, melt season as they put it,\" said Dr Ruth Mottram, a climate scientist at the Danish Meteorological Institute in Copenhagen.\n\"In some ways, the weather pattern is rather similar to the great blocking high that lodged over Scandinavia for weeks in 2018, giving us the most extreme drought on record in much of northern Europe.\"\nThe exact mechanism by which climate change affects the jet stream isn't understood. But the view is that as the Arctic warms, the temperature differences between the region and the mid-latitudes that drive the air current are reduced. This slows down the stream, making it wander further. \n\"The more CO2 we pump out, the more divergence starts to emerge between the behaviour of the Arctic and the mid-latitudes and this behaviour is accelerating and enhancing some of the differences. It is a crucial part of what is creating this waviness and the consequences,\" said Dr Tedesco.\nThe authors also argue that climate models in general need to take account of this impact of the wavy jet stream. Others in the field say this issue needs addressing.\n\"These results imply that the climate models we use for future projections of sea level rise from Greenland are underestimating the extreme years at present and therefore likely also the rate at which the ice sheet melts and the oceans will rise in the future,\" said Dr Mottram.\n\"The only ray of light is that as processor power increases and we can do higher resolution simulations with climate models, the representation of these processes does seem to improve and not just in Greenland but in other areas of the world where persistent blocking patterns can have an important influence on the season.\"\nThe study has been published in the journal on Twitter.. \nFollow Matt \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52200045": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52200045", "title": "Climate change: UK forests 'could do more harm than good'", "published": "Tue, 07 Apr 2020 11:20:00 GMT", "summary": "Mass tree planting could harm the environment if badly planned, a report warns.", "story": "Mass tree planting in the UK could harm the environment if not planned properly, a report warns. \nBadly-planned trees would  increase greenhouse gas emissions,\nThe report comes from the Natural Capital Committee (NCC), which says planting trees into peat bogs would prove a serious mistake.\nPeat locks up vast quantities of carbon - but trees dry out peat.\nThis can release more greenhouse gases than the trees absorb.\nOne NCC member, Prof Ian Bateman from the University of Exeter, said: \u201cThe mantra has to be \u2018the right tree in the right place\u2019.\u201c\n\u201cWe would be crazy to undertake the massive scale of planting being considered if we did not also consider the wider effects upon the environment including impacts on wildlife, benefits in terms of reducing flood risks and effects on water quality, improvements to recreation and so on.\u201d\nThe report adds that carpeting upland pastures with trees would reduce the UK\u2019s ability to produce meat \u2013 which may lead to increasing imports from places that produce beef by felling rainforests.\nIt also makes a similar point on industry.

the early onset of spring and increased drought. \nThey are concerned that this could affect the bird's ability to migrate in winter. \nFamed for its ability to sing, the nightingale has a very rich repertoire as it is able to produce over 1,000 different sounds, compared to just 340 by skylarks. \nAlthough common in many parts of Europe and Asia, the bird is mainly seen and heard in southern

researchers say that ability to migrate may be impeded by climate change. \nScientists in Spain have studied 20 years of data on wing shape in two populations of the birds.\nThey found that the average wing length of the nightingales relative to their body size has decreased. \nThey believe this is related to changes in temperatures seen in the Mediterranean region.\n\"Our results show that spring is delayed and the intensity of the summer drought is higher, which means a shorter optimal breeding period for the birds,\" said Dr Carolina Remacha, from Madrid's Complutense University, who led the study.\n\"We find the unique possibility that shorter wings are being favoured.\"\nThe researchers believe that birds like the nightingale normally adapt to the demands of migration by having longer wings, having a larger clutch size but a shorter lifespan. \nHowever, the changing temperatures are interfering with this and provoking a response from the birds. \nFaced with a shorter breeding season, the researchers believe the most successful birds are having smaller families with smaller wings. \nThey argue that these adaptations are likely to come at a price.\n\"If these changes are the response to the new environment, then obviously the ones that have been selected, the ones with shorter wings, are the optimal nightingales for the new situation,\" said co-author Prof

with the same migration patterns and destinations and therefore their survival is likely to be reduced. \nWhile the scientists say this \"maladaptation\" is evident in the birds they have studied in Spain where there have been droughts in the summer, it may also be impacting other members of the species in different regions.\n\"If the climate is changing in a similar way, and the pressures are

Extreme weather and melting polar ice are among the possible effects. \nThe Earth's average temperature is about 15C but has been much higher and lower in the past.  \nThere are natural fluctuations in the climate but scientists say temperatures are now rising faster than at many other times. \nThis is linked to the greenhouse effect, which describes how the Earth's atmosphere traps some of the Sun's energy. \nSolar energy radiating back to space from the Earth's surface is absorbed by greenhouse gases and re-emitted in all directions. \nThis heats both the lower atmosphere and the surface of the planet. Without this effect, the Earth would be about 30C colder and hostile to life.\nScientists believe we are adding to the natural greenhouse effect, with gases released from industry and agriculture trapping more energy and increasing the temperature. \nThis is known as climate change or global warming.\nThe greenhouse gas with the greatest impact on warming is water vapour. But it remains in the atmosphere for only a few days.\nCarbon dioxide (CO2), however, persists for much longer. It would take hundreds of years for a return to pre-industrial levels and only so much can be soaked up by natural reservoirs such as the oceans.\nMost man-made emissions of CO2 come from burning fossil fuels. When carbon-absorbing forests are cut down and left to rot, or burned, that stored carbon is released, contributing to global warming. \nSince the Industrial Revolution began in about 1750, CO2 levels have risen more than 30%. The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is higher than at any time in at least 800,000 years.\nOther greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide are also released through human activities but they are less abundant than carbon dioxide.\nThe world is about one degree Celsius warmer than before widespread industrialisation, the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says.\nThe 20 warmest years on record all occurred in the past 22 years, with 2015-18 making up the top four.\nAcross the globe, the average sea level increased by 3.6mm per year between 2005 and 2015.  \nMost of this change was because water increases in volume as it heats up.\nHowever, melting ice is now thought to be the main reason for rising sea levels. Most glaciers in temperate regions of the world are retreating.\nAnd satellite records show a dramatic decline in Arctic sea-ice since 1979. The Greenland Ice Sheet has experienced record melting in recent years. \nSatellite data also shows the West Antarctic Ice Sheet is losing mass. A recent study indicated East Antarctica may also have started to lose mass.  \nThe effects of a changing climate can also be seen in vegetation and land animals. These include earlier flowering and fruiting times for plants and changes in the territories of animals.\nThe change in the global surface temperature between 1850 and the end of the 21st Century is likely to exceed 1.5C, most simulations suggest.\nThe WMO says that if the current warming trend continues, temperatures could rise 3-5C by the end of this century.\nTemperature rises of 2C had long been regarded as the gateway to dangerous warming. More recently, scientists and policymakers have argued that \nAn Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report in 2018 suggested that keeping to the 1.5C target would require \"limiting temperature rises to 1.5C is safer. in all aspects of society\".\nThe UN is leading a political effort to stabilise greenhouse-gas emissions. China emits more CO2 than any other country. It is followed by the US and the European Union member states, although emissions per person are much greater there.\nBut even if we now cut greenhouse-gas emissions dramatically, scientists say the effects will continue. Large bodies of water and ice can take hundreds of years to respond to changes in temperature. And it takes CO2 decades to be removed from the atmosphere. \nThere is uncertainty about how great the impact of a changing climate will be. \nIt could cause fresh water shortages, dramatically alter our ability to produce food, and increase the number of deaths from floods, storms and heatwaves. This is because climate change is expected to increase the frequency of extreme weather events - though linking any single event to global warming is complicated.\nAs the world warms, more water evaporates, leading to more moisture in the air. This means many areas will experience more intense rainfall - and in some places snowfall. But the risk of drought in inland areas during hot summers will increase. More flooding is expected from storms and rising sea levels. But there are likely to be very strong regional variations in these patterns.\nPoorer countries, which are least equipped to deal with rapid change, could suffer the most. \nPlant and animal extinctions are predicted as habitats change faster than species can adapt. And the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that the health of millions could be threatened by increases in malaria, water-borne disease and malnutrition.\nAs more CO2 is released into the atmosphere, uptake of the gas by the oceans increases, causing the water to become more acidic. This could pose major problems for coral reefs.\nGlobal warming will cause further changes that are likely to create further heating.

But that feeling brings a certain responsibility: if you are important you've got something to prove.\n\"Here you have nothing to prove because you can only submit,\" says Gabrielle.  \nYou can't feel important in this vast place.\nAnd if you aren't important then things become a lot simpler.\nAntarctica gives you the freedom to ask yourself the questions that really matter, she says.\nWhat is important to me?\nWhat should I be doing with my life?\nWho do I really miss while I am here and why?\nAnd who misses me?\nLots of people are probably asking similar questions as they hunker down at home in the face of the threat of the coronavirus.\nBut, when I finally get to the front of the enormous glacier that the scientists I'm accompanying are here to study, that sense of insignificance dissolves. \nIt feels like I've reached the front line of climate change: the place where the equilibrium that has held our world in balance for tens of thousands of years is beginning to slip and crash.\nIt is impossible to mistake the epic forces at work here.  \nIt is like a scream of anguish caught in the single frame of a photograph.\nThe glacier is being torn and shattered.\nIn places the ice is almost a mile high and is collapsing into the sea at a rate of three miles a year along a front more than 100 miles long\u2026 and the whole process is accelerating.\nNeedless to say, this acceleration - which is affecting the entire West Antarctic Ice Sheet - is the result of the global warming gases our lifestyles produce. \nIt explodes the impression that the ice here is overwhelming.  \nIn fact, the opposite is true, we are overwhelming the ice.\nI am surprised how moved I am by what I've seen.\nA colleague interviews me for a programme we are making and I burst into tears.\nIt takes me days to process my emotions.\nI think about the chain of people who have made this expedition possible: the pilots and aircrew, the people back at the research station who sift the rubbish and cook the meals, the men and women who drive the trucks and groom the ice runways. \nWe wouldn't be here without them.  \nOr the people who agreed the project and signed the cheques.  \nOr the people who paid their taxes, raising the money in the first place.  \nOr, for that matter, my wife looking after the kids back home. \nOur small team has only been able reach the front of this glacier because of a huge human enterprise. \nIt is only by coming together as a community that we can reach remote places like this and only by coming to places like this can we can understand what is happening to our world and what it is likely to mean for us all.  \nAnd, of course, it is only by coming together as a community that we can cut the emissions causing global warming. \nI'm flying back to the research station at McMurdo when I feel a stir of something I haven't felt for a while - hope.\nIt is sometimes claimed that greed, violence and conflict are the key features of humanity, but that is wrong.\nThe defining human characteristic throughout history is actually our ability to co-operate.\nYou may also be interested in:\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51944780": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-51944780", "title": "Coronavirus: Air pollution and CO2 fall rapidly as virus spreads", "published": "Thu, 19 Mar 2020 03:12:40 GMT", "summary": "Some regions show significant drops in air pollutants as the coronavirus hits work and travel.", "story": "Levels of air pollutants and warming gases over some cities and regions are showing significant drops as coronavirus impacts work and travel.\nResearchers in New York told the BBC their early results showed carbon monoxide mainly from cars had been reduced by nearly 50% compared with last year.\nEmissions of the planet-heating gas CO2 have also fallen sharply. \nBut there are warnings levels could rise rapidly after the pandemic. \nWith global economic activity ramping down as a result of the coronavirus pandemic, it is hardly surprising that emissions of a variety of gases related to energy and transport would be reduced. \nScientists say that by May, when CO2 emissions are at their peak thanks to the decomposition of leaves, the levels recorded might be the lowest since the financial crisis over a decade ago. \nWhile it is early days, data collected in New York this week suggests that instructions to curb unnecessary travel are having a significant impact. \nTraffic levels in the city were estimated to be down 35% compared with a year ago. Emissions of carbon monoxide, mainly due to cars and trucks, have fallen by around 50% for a couple of days this week according to researchers at Columbia University.\nThey have also found that there was a 5-10% drop in CO2 over New York and a solid drop in methane as well. \n\"New York has had exceptionally high carbon monoxide numbers for the last year and a half,\" said Prof R\u00f3is\u00edn Commane, from Columbia University, who carried out the New York air monitoring work.\n\"And this is the cleanest I have ever seen it. It's is less than half of what we normally see in March.\"\nAlthough there are a number of caveats to these findings, they echo the environmental impacts connected to the virus outbreaks in China and in Italy.\nAn analysis carried out for the climate website Carbon Brief suggested there had been a 25% drop in energy use and emissions in China over a two week period. This is likely to lead to an overall fall of about 1% in China's carbon emissions this year, experts believe. \nBoth China and Northern Italy have also recorded significant falls in nitrogen dioxide, which is related to reduced car journeys and industrial activity. The gas is a serious air pollutant and also indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet.\nWith aviation grinding to a halt and millions of people working from home, a range of emissions across many countries are likely following the same downward path. \nWhile people working from home will likely increase the use of home heating and electricity, the curbing of commuting and the general slowdown in economies will likely have an impact on overall emissions. \n\"I expect we will have the smallest increase in May to May peak CO2 that we've had in the northern hemisphere since 2009, or even before,\" said Prof Commane.\nThis view is echoed by others in the field, who believe that the shutdown will impact CO2 levels for the whole of this year. \n\"It will depend on how long the pandemic lasts, and how widespread the slowdown is in the economy particularly in the US. But most likely I think we will see something in the global emissions this year,\" said Prof Corinne Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9 from the University of East Anglia.\n\"If it lasts another three of four months, certainly we could see some reduction.\" \nWhat's likely to make a major difference to the scale of carbon emissions and air pollution is how governments decide to re-stimulate their economies once the pandemic eases. \nBack in the 2008-09, after the global financial crash, carbon emissions shot up by 5% as a result of stimulus spending that boosted fossil fuel use. \nIn the coming months, governments will have a chance to alter that outcome. They could insist, for instance, that any bailout of airlines would be tied to far more stringent reductions in aviation emissions.\n\"Governments now have to be really cautious on how they re-stimulate their economies, mindful of not locking in fossil fuels again,\" said Prof Le Qu\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\"They should focus those things that are ready to go that would lower emissions, like renovating buildings, putting in heat pumps and electric chargers. These are not complicated and can be done straight away, they are just waiting for financial incentives.\" \nHowever, some argue that if the pandemic goes on a long time, any stimulus would more likely focus on promoting any economic growth regardless of the impact on the environment. \n\"I certainly think climate could go on the back burner, and in this case, I don't think there is much hope that stimulus goes to clean energy,\" said Prof Glen Peters from the Centre for International Climate Research.\n\"Any stimulus will help those with job losses such as tourism and services. I think this is very different to the global financial crisis. The only silver linings could be to learning new practices to work remotely, and buying a few years of lower growth allowing solar and wind to catch up a bit, though, these may be rather small silver linings.\" \nFollow Matt \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-52104844": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-52104844", "title": "Coronavirus: Astronaut Helen Sharman shares isolation coping strategies", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 23:11:49 GMT", "summary": "The UK's first person in space has past experience of restricted movement and time away from family.", "story": "Astronauts know better than most how to cope with isolation - something many people are now dealing with. As coronavirus restrictions are extended in the UK, can we learn any lessons from space travel?\nDr Helen Sharman, a scientist from Sheffield, became the first British astronaut in 1991. \nHer time in space may have only lasted eight days but before that she spent 18 months a long way from home in intense preparations at the Soviet cosmonaut training camp Star City.\nStargazing, video-calling loved ones and dreaming of the future were all coping strategies people could make use of, she told the BBC.\nMany of the methods she used to get through her time in space, nearly three decades ago, are being echoed now, as - like most people - the 56-year-old spends more time than usual at home. For Dr Sharman, that is in west London. \n\"The main difference is that [in space] we had some element of choice that we went there, we chose our isolation, but nonetheless we were with our crewmates in a small environment and not able to go out when we wanted,\" she said.\n\"Think about what you can do, rather than what you can't,\" said Dr Sharman, who became the first woman to visit the space station Mir. \n\"Astronauts prepare themselves to be isolated on a space station but, back in 1991, we only had a radio to communicate, there was no satellite phone, no email. \n\"Now we have all these ways to keep in touch with people, and it's so important that we use them.\"\nDr Sharman, who now works at Imperial College, London, said she had adapted like so many to working at home.\n\"We are all being more tolerant of each other's circumstances,\" she said.\n\"We don't have to be in the office, in a dress or a shirt and tie, we can be more flexible.\"\nShe stressed that feeling useful was important to people, both in space and on Earth.\n\"I was grateful to have a busy working day because it made me feel useful,\" she said. \"If suddenly our work diminishes and our days become less busy, we can feel at a loss.\"\nBeing useful could come in the form of reaching out to others who were self-isolating, perhaps, or being able to work from home.\nDr Sharman has spent time doing things she has never had time for before - such as reading a bedtime story online for OSO Arts Centre, not far from where she lives.\n\"I didn't previously have the time to do it but now I can feel as if I am providing a service,\" she said. \nAnother coping strategy she suggested was to appreciate nature, something many people seem to be doing with their unexpected free time at the moment.  \n\"I find now I am looking outside my window much more than I did before,\" Dr Sharman said. \n\"I can see the houses on the other side of the road, a tree about to burst into flower. I look at the clouds and appreciate the beauty of nature.\"\nLooking at the stars, has also made her feel connected to distant friends and relatives. \n\"Then I was looking down at the clouds, now it is up, but it is just that appreciation of the world outside my window. We are all in it,\" she said.\n\"If we look into the night sky, we can all see that same moon. That is a nice uniting concept - the stars in the Northern Hemisphere all look the same. \n\"We can appreciate that all our relatives are seeing that same view that we are.\"\nDr Sharman appreciates living in a confined space with other people may have its challenges. \nShe said it \"requires a bit more respect and tolerance than normal to maintain cordial relations\", something many people who share homes may understand. \n\"We need to understand each other's frustrations, what annoys us and what helps us to relax,\" she said. \"And it helps if the grotty jobs are shared (tasks like compacting the solid toilet waste and changing air filters are done on rotation in space).\" \nMaking plans for your free time can be another way to stay sane in isolation, Dr Sharman said.\n\"One of the luxuries astronauts enjoy is scheduled free time. Earth-gazing, books and films figure highly,\" she said.\n\"Now, Covid-19 means we can do some of the things we have always wanted to do but were previously too busy for. \n\"And we can plan something nice to look forward to because this will not last for ever.\"\nLooking at how the pandemic may change society, Dr Sharman said when she was in space, she did not once think about her possessions and on returning to Earth had a different view on materialism. \n\"Being less of a consumer society will benefit the environment and reserve resources for what we really need, but I think we will feel the change in society that will be more communal, more cohesive and generally nicer,\" she said. \n\"When the pandemic is over, the world will be a better place to live in.\"\nHelen Sharman has previously spoken about her isolation tips to the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52264743": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52264743", "title": "Apollo 13: Enhanced images reveal life on stricken spacecraft", "published": "Sun, 12 Apr 2020 23:44:46 GMT", "summary": "Enhanced images reveal life aboard Nasa's stricken Apollo 13 spacecraft in unprecedented detail.", "story": "Fifty years ago, the craft suffered an explosion that jeopardised the lives of the three astronauts aboard.\nUnsurprisingly, given they were locked in a fight for survival, relatively few onboard images were taken.\nBut imaging specialist Andy Saunders created sharp stills from low-quality 16mm film shot by the crew.\nOne of the techniques used by Mr Saunders is known as \"stacking\", in which many frames are assembled on top of each other to improve the image's detail.\nCrewed by Nasa astronauts Jim Lovell, Jack Swigert and Fred Haise, Apollo 13 was supposed to be the third American mission to land on the lunar surface. During the journey to the Moon, an explosion in the service module allowed some of the spacecraft's oxygen to leak out into space.\nAstronaut Jack Swigert reported the accident to ground controllers with the immortal, and much misquoted, phrase: \nThe part of the Apollo spacecraft designed to return the astronauts through Earth's atmosphere after the mission - the command module (CM) - had to be shut down to conserve its remaining resources for re-entry. The crew had to use the lunar module (LM) - also known as the lander - as a lifeboat.\nThe lander's life support systems were designed for two astronauts living for two days on the lunar surface. Experts at Nasa's Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas, had to figure out a way to stretch its resources so that it could support three crew members for four days.\nLovell, Swigert and Haise looped around the Moon and back to Earth in a cold, damp module with limited drinking water. Luckily, the improvised plan to get them back was a success, and the three astronauts splashed down safely into the Pacific Ocean.\nDespite their grave predicament, the crew used a 16mm film camera to record scenes of life aboard the spacecraft. But the footage is of low quality by today's standards.\nIt is this footage that Mr Saunders used as the basis of his enhanced images, which reveal new insights into the crew's fight for survival aboard the damaged spacecraft.\nA composite panorama of the lunar module \"lifeboat\" shows Commander Jim Lovell's attempts at normality by selecting some music on a tape player, while command module pilot Jack Swigert takes a  nap in the storage area.\nAnother, dubbed \"Happy crew\" by Mr Saunders, captures Lovell and Swigert in apparent high spirits. \n\"One striking thing about the 16mm footage is how calm the crew appear, given the grave nature of the situation, the conditions, and the critical mission tasks that lay ahead,\" Mr Saunders told BBC News. \"This perhaps belies their true feelings as we know that, in reality, the crew doubted if they would make it home alive.\"\nThe crew members are eating in the scene. The freeze-dried food relied on mixing it with hot water, but only cold water was available. Lovell later admitted he had eaten little in the days following the accident, losing 6kg (14lb) in weight.\nA panorama of the dark, powered-down command module was produced from footage shot by Fred Haise when he went to check it out before the rest of the crew moved back in for the risky return through the Earth's atmosphere.\nIn an interview for a new Nasa documentary called \"Okay, Houston, we've had a problem here.\", Haise recalls how damp it was in the CM. The astronauts had to wipe down the panels with towels because of a concern that the water could cause an electrical short that could lead to a fire. This would have been catastrophic in the spacecraft's enclosed environment.\nTwo concepts are important for understanding the technique used to process the images: signal - the parts of the image that are desirable to keep - and noise - the unwanted parts of the image. Mr Saunders started by stacking different frames of the same scene on top of one another.\n\"It all hinges on the principle that stacking images improves the signal-to-noise ratio,\" Mr Saunders explained.\nHe added: \"As the noise in each frame is truly random, then stacking multiple frames of the same scene on top of each other and averaging out the levels of each aligned pixel has the effect of identifying and reducing noise whilst maintaining signal (the signal will be present on all frames).\"\nThis ultimately boosts the detail, along with overall image quality, making it more \"photo-like\".\nBut because he was dealing with moving pictures, Mr Saunders had to re-align multiple parts of the image, combining all the results into one final picture. These combined images are made up of more than 20 sections stitched together, with each section consisting of a stack of up to 75 separate processed frames, revealing the crew and spacecraft in unprecedented detail.\nUsing commercial software, he then enhanced the photos; adjusting the contrast, correcting the colour and removing some of the \"fish-eye\" effect resulting from the wide angle lens that was needed to capture events in such a confined space.\nFollow Paul \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52243605": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-52243605", "title": "UK Biobank: DNA to unlock coronavirus secrets", "published": "Tue, 14 Apr 2020 16:11:36 GMT", "summary": "A vast store of DNA is being used to study why the severity of symptoms for coronavirus is so varied.", "story": "UK Biobank - which contains samples from 500,000 volunteers, as well as detailed information about their health - is now adding Covid-19 data.\nIt is hoped genetic differences could explain why some people with no underlying health conditions can develop severe illness.\nMore than 15,000 scientists from around the world have access to UK Biobank.\nProf Rory Collins, principal investigator of the project, said it would be \u201ca goldmine for researchers\u201d.\n\u201cWe could go very quickly into getting some very, very important discoveries,\u201d he said.\nSome people with coronavirus have no symptoms - and scientists are trying to establish what proportion this is. \nOthers have a mild to moderate disease. \nBut about one in five people has a much more severe illness and an estimated 0.5-1% die.  \nUK Biobank has blood, urine and saliva samples from 500,000 volunteers whose health has been tracked over the past decade\nAnd it has already helped to answer questions about how diseases such as cancer, stroke and dementia develop. \nNow, information about positive coronavirus tests, as well as hospital and GP data, will be added. \nProf Collins said: \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the data in UK Biobank to understand the differences between those individuals. \n\u201cWhat are the differences in their genetics?

Only two are left in the world - both are female. But scientists have an outlandish plan to save them from extinction. \nWhen I went to meet the rhinos in Kenya, they began circling the car.\nSo I was alarmed when their caregiver, James Mwenda, opened the car door. \n\"We can get out of the car?\" I asked.\n\"Yeah, they're calm,\" he assured me.\nBut when I did, one ran towards me - it didn't seem very calm.\nI hid behind the other side of the car as Mr Mwenda tried to reassure me that they were not scared of humans, though it didn't stop me being scared of rhinos. \nThe rhino, called Najin, who had approached us was tame because she had been brought up in a zoo in the Czech Republic. \nShe now lives in a massive fenced off area of Ol Pejeta Conservancy in central Kenya. \nIn 2009 she was one of four northern white rhinos, two male and two female, who were brought from the Dv\u016fr Kr\u00e1lov\u00e9 Zoo in the Czech Republic to this large enclosure in an attempt to get them to breed.\nThe thinking was that if they were taken to a rhino's natural habitat this might change. \nBut it didn't work. The four mated but the two females, Najin and her daughter Fatu, did not give birth.\nThen the two males died. First 34-year-old Suni, who died of natural causes in 2014. Then, four years later, 45-year-old Sudan was put down because of wounds to his skin that would not heal - and his muscles and bones had degenerated.\nNow Najin and Fatu are the only northern white rhinos left in the world - and neither can carry a pregnancy. \nThis has not deterred scientists from all over the world from trying to save the species - and they have come up with a rather extraordinary scheme.\nIt involves carefully preserved sperm - taken from Suni and Sudan and other male northern white rhinos before they died.\nThey had collected it with the intention of artificially inseminating the females, including southern white rhinos. \nThere are two sub-species of white rhinos in Africa - the near-extinct northern white rhino and the more prevalent southern white rhino.\nHowever, these insemination attempts failed.\nSo they moved on to trying to make an embryo - an egg fertilised by sperm - in the lab.\nThat created another challenge: getting hold of the egg.\nFor the veterinary expert leading the process it proved very complicated indeed to reach the ovaries - where eggs are stored - as they are at least 1.5m (4.9ft) inside a female rhino. \nIntestinal loops also get in the way, Dr Thomas Hildebrandt, from the Leibniz Institute for Zoo and Wildlife Research (IZW) in Berlin, told me.  \nAnd a tube cannot be put into a rhino's vagina as can be done with humans and horses, he says.\nIn big cats, vets go through the abdomen to get to the ovaries, explains Dr Hildebrandt, who heads IZW's reproduction unit. \nBut this involves cutting the skin, something that cannot be done to rhinos as theirs is around 5cm (2in) thick.\nWhile it protects them when they get into fights, it never heals so if cut they will eventually die. \nMade of two subspecies: Northern white rhinos and southern white rhinos\nSo Dr Hildebrandt created an instrument to collect the eggs.\nIt was a tube, which enters through the anus, and has a long delicate needle at its end with which to pierce an ovary follicle, where an egg is stored. The needle is connected to a suction device which sucks the egg down the long tube.\n\"You need to operate it precisely,\" he explains about the instrument he has patented.\n\"Otherwise you can puncture a huge blood vessel which has a diameter of a child's arm\".\nThat would result in internal bleeding and ultimately death so he uses a 4D ultrasound scanner, enabling him to see everything during the procedure. \nIf done correctly the effect on the rhino is minimal, Dr Hildebrandt says.\nBut the operation can be no longer than two hours as that is how long a rhino can be safely anaesthetised. \nLast year, he managed to extract 19 eggs in total from both Najin and Fatu. \nThe next step was to fertilise the egg with the sperm.\nFor this pioneering work, they needed an in vitro fertilisation (IVF) expert. \nCesare Galli, based in the Avantea private lab in Italy, fitted the bill.\nSo as soon as the eggs were collected, they had to be rushed from Kenya to Italy.  \nProf Galli had struggled to make embryos from other rhino species in the past as sperm from rhinos tends to be of a low quality as it is mixed with urine.\n\"That's because, to get the sperm, they go up the rectum and electrocute the rhino to make the sperm come out, this method makes sperm and urine and other liquids come out altogether.\"\nDr Galli took years to perfect the method with Sumatran rhinos and southern white rhinos, making a breakthrough by electrocuting an egg to get it and the sperm to form an embryo. \nThe practice paid off. \nWith the rarer northern white rhino sperm and eggs he was confident he knew what would work.  \nHe made two embryos with the first delivery of eggs in August 2019 and one more embryo with the second delivery four months later.\nThey are currently being preserved in his lab.\nTo grow, these embryos need a womb - but neither Fatu's nor Najin's are suitable. \nNineteen-year-old Fatu has never had a calf despite mating.\nWhen vets gave her an ultrasound they found she had no lining on her uterus, meaning she cannot carry a pregnancy to full term, said Stephen Ngulu, a vet at the Ol Pejeta Conservancy.\nFatu's 30-year-old mother, Najin, has weak hind legs - as issue because when rhinos are pregnant the hormone progesterone changes the dynamics of their legs. \n\"If she falls down and you can't get her up and then that's it - you lose her and you lose the baby,\" Dr Ngulu says.\nThey are not going to take that risk. \nInstead they plan to use southern white rhino surrogates. \nBut Dr Galli says there is still so much they don't know about the reproductive system of rhinos.\nAttempts in the past to put embryos in southern white rhinos in zoos have failed. \nOne of the things the scientists are struggling to work out is the timing to implant the embryo.\nThey need to know exactly when the body is best ready for it to attach to the uterus lining. \nIn women, the menstrual cycle determines when to implant an embryo.\nBut not all animals have menstrual cycles - some animals, including cats, release their eggs when they mate. \nIf this is also true for rhinos then it is possible to use sexual intercourse as an indicator, Dr Galli explains.\nIn other words, it may be possible that the scientists increase the chances of the surrogate carrying the pregnancy through to birth if they implant the embryo after she has had sex. \nThis hunch has led them to set the scene for the next stage in their elaborate plan. \nFour wild female southern white rhinos have been enclosed with their offspring in their natural habitat not far from the last two remaining northern white rhinos. \nThe next step is to put a sterilised southern white rhino in with the females - and would-be surrogates.\n\"So if you see that bull mounting, you say: 'Rhino's ready.' You dart that rhino, you put the embryo in. That's the dream,\" says Dr Ngulu.\nI went to see the potential surrogates. \nUnlike Najin and Fatu, they are wild so they can be hard to track down in the sprawling enclosure. \nWhen we found them, on the second day of searching, I couldn't help but think that these rhinos do not know it yet, but one of them may save a species from extinction.\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52217636": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52217636", "title": "Crops were cultivated in regions of the Amazon '10,000 years ago'", "published": "Wed, 08 Apr 2020 15:01:29 GMT", "summary": "Humans have grown crops in areas of the Amazon since the end of the last ice age, a study says.", "story": "Far from being a pristine wilderness, some regions of the Amazon have been profoundly altered by humans dating back 10,000 years, say researchers. \nAn international team found that during this period, crops were being cultivated in a remote location in what is now northern Bolivia. \nThe scientists believe that the humans who lived here were planting squash, cassava and maize. \nThe inhabitants also created thousands of artificial islands in the forest.\nThe end of the last ice age, around 12,000 years ago, saw a sustained rise in global temperatures that initiated many changes around the world.\nPerhaps the most important of these was that early civilisations began to move away from living as hunter-gatherers and started to cultivate crops for food. \nResearchers have previously unearthed evidence that crops were domesticated at four important locations around the world.\nSo China saw the cultivation of rice, while in the Middle East it was grains, in Central America and Mexico it was maize, while potatoes and quinoa emerged in the Andes. \nNow scientists say that the Llanos de Moxos region of southwestern Amazonia should be seen as a fifth key region.\nThe area is a savannah but is dotted with raised areas of land now covered with trees. \nThe area floods for part of the year but these \"forest islands\" remain above the waters.  \nSome 4,700 of these small mounds were developed by humans over time, in a very mundane way.\n\"These are just places where people dropped their rubbish, and over time they grow,\" said lead author Dr Umberto Lombardo from the University of Bern, Switzerland.\n\"Of course, rubbish is very rich in nutrients, and as these areas grow they rise above the level of the flood during the rainy season, so they become good places to settle with fertile soil, so people come back to the same places all the time.\"\nThe researchers examined some 30 of these islands for evidence of crop planting. \nThey discovered tiny fragments of silica called phytoliths, described as tiny pieces of glass that form inside the cells of plants.\nThe shape of these tiny glass fragments are different, depending on which plants they come from.\nThe researchers were able to identify evidence of manioc (cassava, yuca) that were grown 10,350 years ago.

These act like rings in a tree trunk, increasing as the animal gets older. \nBut scientists have been unsure about how often these rings can form and the reasons behind them.\nNow researchers say they have come up with a much more accurate way of determining the whale sharks' true age. \nFrom the late 1940s, several nations including the US, the Soviet Union, Great Britain, France and China conducted atomic bomb tests in different locations. \nOne side effect of all these explosions was the doubling of an atom type, or isotope, called Carbon-14 in the atmosphere. \nOver time, every living thing on the planet has absorbed this extra Carbon-14 which still persists. \nBut as scientists know the rate at which this isotope decays, it is a very useful marker in determining age.  \nThe older the creature, the less Carbon-14 you'd expect to find. \n\"So any animal that was alive then incorporated that spike in Carbon-14 into their hard parts,\" said author Dr Mark Meekan, from the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Perth.\n\"That means we've got a time marker within the vertebrae that means we can work out the periodicity at which those isotopes decay.\"\nOne of the difficulties with ageing these sharks has been in getting access to samples of vertebrae. \nThis team managed to find two long-dead specimens stored in Pakistan and Taiwan.\nThe study indicated that these creatures do actually live an incredibly long time. \n\"The absolute longevity of these animals could be very, very old, possibly as much as 100-150 years old,\" said Dr Meekan.\n\"This has huge implications for the species. It suggests that these things are probably intensely vulnerable to over-harvesting.\"\nThe scientists say their results explain why whale shark numbers have collapsed in locations like Thailand and Taiwan where fishing has taken place. \n\"They are just not built for humans to exploit,\" said Dr Meekan.\nWhile the species has recently been upgraded from threatened to endangered on the IUCN Red List, the scientists believe that their work will help efforts at conservation.\nBy being able to accurately estimate the age of whale sharks, the scientists will be able to provide more accurate guidance on how well a population is doing and whether any fishing can be allowed.\nIn many tropical regions, whale shark tourism is now a major attraction. The researchers say that encouraging co-operation between different countries along the vast routes that whale sharks follow is key to their survival.\n\"Whale sharks are a fantastic ambassador for marine life and one that has lifted so many people out of poverty,\" added Dr Meekan.\n\"This is a good news story - and it shows there is a silver lining to the mushroom cloud after all,\" he quipped. \nThe study has been published in the journal Frontiers in Marine Science. \nFollow Matt \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52204614": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-52204614", "title": "Event Horizon Telescope: Black hole produces twisting jet", "published": "Tue, 07 Apr 2020 17:02:43 GMT", "summary": "The team behind the first image of a black hole reveals something else from that historic picture.", "story": "One year on from publishing the first ever image of a black hole, the team behind that historic breakthrough is back with a new picture.\nThis time we're being shown the base of a colossal jet of excited gas, or plasma, screaming away from another black hole at near light-speed.\nThe scene was actually in the \"background\" of the original target.\nThe scientists who operate the Event Horizon Telescope describe the jet \n.\nThey say their studies of the region of space known as 3C 279 will help them better understand the physics that drives behaviour in the vicinity of black holes.\n3C 279 is what astronomers term a quasar - the extremely bright core of a very distant galaxy. This one is about 5.5 billion light-years from Earth.\nIt is well known, and was used as the calibration target to align the performance of the EHT's eight individual radio telescopes when they simultaneously made their astonishing map of the supermassive black hole at the centre of Galaxy M87.\nThe remarkable resolution achieved by the EHT - put to such great effect with M87 - pays dividends again with 3C 279, because we see previously unrecognised features.\n3C 279 also has a supermassive black hole at its heart. It's about one billion times the mass of our Sun and its gravity is pulling in and shredding any stars or gas that get too close. This material is likely being accreted on to a disc that winds around the hole, but some of it is being shot back out into space along two jets moving in opposite directions.\nIn previous images of 3C 279, we've been able to detect the outline of the jet that moves towards us (the one moving in the opposite direction is not detected). But in the new EHT picture, we can resolve detail close to the point where this jet leaves the black hole. What's more, this base area seems twisted and somewhat offset from the main axis of the jet.\n\"It's curious,\" said EHT Collaboration member Dr Ziri Younsi. \"We're seeing a region that's actually pretty close to the black hole. It could be an interaction layer where the jet couples to the accretion disc and extracts all of its energy from the black hole. \n\"We don't really understand how jets are powered by black holes. Black holes, when they rotate rapidly, are the most efficient liberators of energy in the Universe, but the mechanism by which the jet can extract that energy is unknown. There are a few ideas, but we're not sure yet which one is the right one,\" the University College London, UK, researcher told BBC News.\nThe data in the images of M87 and 3C 279 was collected by the ENT's widely dispersed array of radio telescopes in 2017. The project has gone on to collect data on the supermassive black hole that exists at the centre of our own galaxy, the Milky Way. \n\"We have that data - of a region we call Sagittarius A*,\" said Dr Younsi. \"We are working on it right now and although we have some preliminary results, these can't be shared just yet. We hope to have something perhaps before the end of this year.\" The team finds itself in a position to concentrate on this analysis because the observational time it had booked on the EHT array for this year got \n.\nA PDF of the A&A paper describing 3C 279 \n. Its lead author is Dr Jae-Young Kim from the Max Planck Institute for Radio Astronomy in Bonn, Germany.\n is a \"virtual telescope\" that links a large array of radio receivers - from the South Pole, to Hawaii, to the Americas and Europe. It uses a technique called very long baseline array interferometry (VLBI). This combines the observations from the dispersed network to mimic a telescope aperture that can produce the resolution necessary to perceive a pinprick on the sky. For the EHT, this pinprick is measured in microarcseconds. \nTo convey such performance to the general public, EHT team-members talk about the sharpness of vision as being the equivalent of seeing from Earth something the size of a grapefruit on the surface of the Moon.\n and follow me on Twitter: \nin the journal Astronomy & Astrophysics\ncancelled in the coronavirus outbreak\nis available here\nThe Event Horizon Telescope\n@BBCAmos\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}}, "technology": {"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52319093": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52319093", "title": "Google blocking 18m coronavirus scam emails every day", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 09:10:45 GMT", "summary": "Google sees a huge spike in phishing attacks as criminals exploit people's fears over Covid-19.", "story": "Scammers are sending 18 million hoax emails about Covid-19 to Gmail users every day, according to Google.\nThe tech giant says the pandemic has led to an explosion of phishing attacks in which criminals try to trick users into revealing personal data.  \nThe company said it was blocking more than 100 million phishing emails a day.

It will use Bluetooth to detect contact with people within one to two metres.

They would not have to speak to a health advisor or wait for a medical test result.\nThis would send a cascade of alerts to people they had recently been in proximity to, advising them to go back into self-isolation.\nThe experts say \"speed is of the essence\", and that delaying contact tracing by even a day from the onset of symptoms could make the difference between epidemic control and resurgence.\n\"There would be more people receiving notifications as a result of false warnings,\" explained Prof Christophe Fraser.\n\"But actually, it results in fewer days of people in self-isolation and quarantine, because the effect of suppressing the epidemic more quickly outweighs the risks in waiting for a test before the notification.\" \nThe over-70s have not been factored in, on the basis they would remain \"shielded\" by staying at home, he added.\nThe Oxford University academics are a mix of epidemiologists and ethicists advising NHSX - the health service's digital innovation unit - on what basis the contact-tracing app should be created. They are not involved in coding or designing the software itself.\nTheir model takes into account different age groups, household structures and movement patterns in an effort to try to maximise the number of people who could be allowed to freely move about once a contact-tracing app has been launched.\n\"We're looking at introducing the app towards the end of lockdown,\" Prof Fraser added.\n\"When you install it, it needs a few days to start recording data before it can be fully functional.\"\nThe group first published a paper about its work at the end of March.\nSince then, they have adjusted their model to take account of changing factors, including the fact that Covid-19's infection rate has been faster than they had anticipated.\nThey have also changed plans from using a system that relied on GPS location readings and scanning QR codes to one that exclusively depends on Bluetooth signals. This has been done to provide users more privacy, which in turn could encourage take-up.\nThe hope is that using the app, as well as other measures such as hand-washing and social distancing from vulnerable members of the population, will prevent a second peak in infections or the need for repeated national lockdowns.\nThe team estimates that 56% of the general population must use the app to halt the outbreak. Prof Fraser said that equated to 80% of all existing smartphone owners, based on data from Ofcom.\n\"That's a very ambitious target,\" the professor acknowledged.\n\"It's not something that would typically happen for a new app - even an incredibly popular one - but if we can explain that this is a public health intervention, that will be new and different.\n\"Some of my colleagues have... commissioned large surveys in multiple European countries including the UK.\n\"More than 80% of people surveyed said they were likely to or would install this app when it was explained in detail what it would be doing.\"\nEven if fewer people install the app, the team estimates that one infection will be averted for every one to two users.\nThe Oxford team suggests that use of the tool should be voluntary. However, this will pose a challenge. \nOn 20 March, Singapore became one of the first countries to deploy a voluntary contact-tracing app, TraceTogether.\nBut only about 12% of the population installed it, and after a spike in new cases the city-state introduced a lockdown on 7 April, which it termed a \"circuit-breaker\".\nTo further complicate matters, a small number of phones still in use in the UK do not support the Bluetooth Low Energy system required, making the target even harder to reach.\nProf Fraser said that officials were discussing giving smartphones to those without - or cheaper, wearable Bluetooth devices - in order to boost the number of citizens involved.\nNHSX is also keen to keep the app opt-in.\nBut some have already started exploring the implications of it becoming obligatory.\nInternet law expert Prof Lillian Edwards has drafted a law to safeguard citizens' rights that says:\nOthers - including the cyber-security expert Ross Anderson and AI entrepreneur Kai-Fu Lee - have cast doubt over whether contact-tracing apps have any chance of success, and fear they could give \"false hope\" to politicians looking for a way out of lockdowns.\n",

frequently failing to clamp down on false posts, particularly when they were in languages other than English.\nFacebook said the research did not reflect the work it had done recently.\nThe California

the move will \"connect people who may have interacted with harmful misinformation about the virus with the truth from authoritative sources, in case they see or hear these claims again off of Facebook\".\nThe changes have been prompted by a major study of misinformation on the platform across six languages by Avaaz, a crowdfunded activist group.\nResearchers say millions of Facebook users continue to be exposed to coronavirus misinformation, without any warning on the platform. \nThe group found some of the most dangerous falsehoods had received hundreds of thousands of views,

misinformation crisis. \n\"But the company is turning a critical corner today to clean up this toxic information ecosystem, becoming the first social media platform to alert all users who have been exposed to coronavirus misinformation, and directing them to life-saving facts.\" \nOne of the falsehoods that researchers tracked was the claim that people could rid the body of the virus by drinking a lot of water and gargling with salt or vinegar. The post was shared more than 31,000 times before eventually being taken down after Avaaz flagged it to Facebook.\nHowever, more than 2,600 clones of the post remain on the platform, with nearly 100,000 interactions and most of these cloned posts have no warning labels from Facebook.\nMark Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, defended his company's work in an online post saying: \"On Facebook and Instagram, we've now directed more than two billion people to authoritative health resources via our Covid-19 Information Center and educational pop-ups, with more than 350 million people clicking through to learn more.\n\"If a piece of content contains harmful misinformation that could lead to imminent physical harm, then we'll take it down.

The UK government set a target of 100,000 tests per day by the end of April, but has struggled to get near that number.\nA test to see if someone has the coronavirus is a complicated process (different tests, which see if someone has ever had the virus are still awaiting approval).\nMolecules on a swab are broken down into genetic code, using chemicals, liquid handling robots and a PCR (polymerase chain reaction) machine which can make billions of copies of DNA strands.\nPrivate and university laboratories across the UK have donated enough equipment for three huge testing centres in Glasgow, Milton Keynes and Alderley Park in Cheshire. \nBut having the machines is not enough, they also need blended cocktails of chemicals to function.\nThese secret recipes have been tested over time, verified by regulators and guarded by the companies that sell them. \nLike a cook with a ready-bake cake mix, scientists know all the ingredients, but the exact proportions are specific to each company. \nThe firms that manufacture and sell them include Qiagen, Roche, Merck and Eurofins Genomics. Each have their own recipes, designed for specific models of the PCR machines. \nDr Swanton and his colleagues at the Crick Institute realised that most of the world would be clamouring for these kits.

At the same time, Mr Nurse sent an email to his employees at the Crick Institute asking for possible volunteers for a lab. \nHe received 300 replies in 24 hours. \nClinicians including Dr Swanton, many from the University College London, and some at a private lab nearby in St Pancras called HSL (Health Service Laboratories), worked together to find a new procedure for making the chemical kits with the equipment that the government had left behind.\nDr Swanton now leads the Covid-19 testing efforts at the Crick Institute.\n\"We have the staff here, the facilities, the resources, the reagents and the know-how to get on and just do it. And so that's what we chose to do,\" says Dr Swanton. \nTheir home-made chemical kit (an RNA extraction kit) has been approved through a rapid accreditation process and they have made \nThe test for Covid-19 uses two stages of pre-packed chemical kits to extract the genetic material from the mucus and cells found on a skin swab. \nIn this part of the test, the virus's genetic code, its RNA, or ribonucleic acid, is found, cleaned and separated. \nEnzymes and other chemicals break up all of the cells that are sent in on the tip of the swab. \nEnzymes called proteases break up proteins in the sample. (Similar chemicals are added to laundry detergent to cut up the proteins in food stains.)\nAnother set of chemicals stick the RNA to a membrane.\nAnd the reaction takes place in a liquid called a buffer. \nAt this point, the RNA is still too small to be detected.  This is when the second chemical cocktail comes into play. \nThis chemical cocktail allows the virus RNA code in the PCR machine to reproduce itself. \nHere the RNA is converted to a form of DNA, covered in fluorescent chemicals and copies are made until there are enough to detect.\nIf enough bright spots show, the test indicates that the virus was present in the sample.\nThe companies that are better known for making these chemical kits warn against reverse engineering them under the current circumstances.\nDr Thomas Theuringer, a spokesperson for Qiagen, a German chemicals company that supplies reagents to the UK, says replacing these reagent cocktails with home-made recipes is \"playing with fire\". \n\"We can only guarantee that our extractions work if we make them in our production facilities where we have a controlled environment. Any mis-step and you might get a false positive and create more harm than good,\" he says. \nSeveral reagents produced by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) in the US failed to produce conclusive results. The CDC later admitted that kits had been \"rushed\". \n\"We are not talking about baking a cake - this is about life and death,\" says Dr Theuringer. \nThe benefit of using commercial solutions, he says, is that Qiagen has been making them for a long time and that the standard operating procedures in their labs have been verified by several international health organisations. \nRoche, a company which also currently makes reagent kits for UK testing sites, agrees. \n\"The primary obstacles in another company or manufacturer producing any Roche test and reagents are time and expertise. Roche cannot guarantee safety and reliability if the reagents required for the test were manufactured outside our production network,\" a spokesman told the BBC in an email. \nStanford University professor Eric Kool says: \"People have used home-brews for RNA extraction for a long time but for scaling up testing needs to be done in an automated fashion so that you can process many samples.\"\nProf Kool teaches chemistry at Stanford, has his own RNA extraction kit business and offered to help the effort in the United States, but testing centres there told him his kits were not the right kind for the machines they had in place. \n\"Kind of like printer ink - you have to buy the right one for the printer,\" he says. \n\"These kits are all corporate secrets,\" he says, but adds that the automated kits have plug-ins which work best with the kind of 24-hour testing that needs to be done with Covid-19.\n\"Even while people are sleeping, the robots can be running samples,\" he says.\nThis is the nub of the problem with large testing sites, like the ones built by the government. \nThe PCR machines they have collected from labs across the UK will work best with the chemical kits which are in the shortest supply.\nThe problem is worldwide, everyone is trying to get hold of the same automated RNA extraction kit. \nTo add to the complexity, the companies that sell them have differing ideas on which buyers should take priority. \nThis has been a difficult prospect for Qiagen, says its representative, Dr Theuringer, because his company has had to find a version of what fair allocation might be. \n\"No one company alone can help meet the demand,\" he says. \nIt went from manufacturing 1.5 million kits a month to 20 million per month, hired new staff and moved from a three-shift day to working around the clock. \nEven so, they have been unable to meet demand, and even passed buyers on to their competitors. \nRoche says it remains committed to its partnership with the UK government. \nBut its spokesman warns that \"due to the high demand on reagents and consumables the supply situation may be challenging in the short term in some cases\".\nDr Swanton cannot tell whether making their own test kits for local NHS staff was the right decision. \n\"Only time will tell,\" he says, \"But we thought that doing nothing was not an option, really.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52210938": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-52210938", "title": "Computer games: More than a lockdown distraction", "published": "Mon, 13 Apr 2020 23:04:47 GMT", "summary": "People are turning to computer games while confined at home during due to the coronavirus pandemic.", "story": "Chris Conway had been planning a surprise birthday party for a housemate, and that was the plan until 20 March when Oregon's governor told all residents to stay at home.\nNo-one was to go out unless absolutely necessary because of the Covid-19 pandemic, so Mx Conway and their friends had to get creative. \nThey decided to throw a party in an online video game instead, Animal Crossing: New Horizons, which was coincidentally released for the Nintendo Switch on the same day as Oregon's stay-at-home order.\nMeeting instead on a Sunday evening as colourful characters in the game, the friends hung out, chatted to one another and explored the virtual world. A world free of coronavirus.\n\"It's been really nice just to go to the game and hang out with each other,\" Mx Conway says. In Animal Crossing, players can join in a variety of activities, from fishing to playing musical instruments.\nThis is far from the only social event to have taken place in Animal Crossing since it was released. Some have even met up for dates in the game.\nWith restaurants, bars, leisure centres and other facilities closed across much of the world, people are having to find creative ways to maintain social connections, and have fun despite being stuck at home.\nWeekly game sales have risen between 40% and 60%, according to analysts at Futuresource. Much of that has been aided by the release of Animal Crossing and other new titles like Call of Duty: Warzone, which allow people to meet up in-game.\nGamers are also spending more time in virtual worlds and using more internet bandwidth to connect.\nFor many, games don't just provide a way of connecting with quarantined friends, they are also alternate universes where the reality of pandemic can be momentarily forgotten.\nBy day, Mx Conway is a delivery driver for a wine distributor. \n\"We got classed as essential retail so we're still open,\" they said.\nAlthough bars and restaurants are no longer purchasing stock, shops that sell alcohol to the public have made far larger orders than usual. After a long day at work, an online getaway in Animal Crossing beckons.\n\"It's really been wonderful just to give my time after work a little bit more structure,\" says Mx Conway.\nToday, there are hundreds of games featuring gigantic worlds that allow people to meet online. Eve Online, for example, contains 7,800 star systems where players co-operate with, or battle against, one another.\nHilmar P\u00e9tursson, chief executive of CCP Games which owns Eve Online, told the BBC that the firm had previously recorded about 7,000 new accounts per day, and then, on 14 March, that jumped to 11,000.\nThe surge coincided with the announcement of a lockdown in Spain, and followed the nationwide lockdown in Italy, on 9 March.\n\"Our game is famous for being a very social game,\" he says. \"Netflix and all that is good for passing time, but that doesn't really give you a social context. And people are craving a social context.\"\nEve Online is a demanding game, he adds, which forces people to work together to overcome various challenges in social groups, which helps players forge friendships.\nAt a time when there are so many restrictions on daily life, people are turning to games in order to satisfy certain basic psychological needs, says Prof Andrew Przybylski at the Oxford Internet Institute. \nSocialising is one such need, but so are feelings of being in control and having a choice over what one does. Games offer that even though the physical spaces around us currently may not.\nProf Przybylski himself has enjoyed dipping back in to games he mastered when he was still at school, including Starcraft and Age of Empires II.\nHe can still remember how to win when playing against the computer, and it's that familiarity which makes them comforting distractions.\n\"That sense of efficacy, that sense of control over my environment, is something that this crisis has fundamentally robbed me of,\" says Prof Przybylski.\nGames, he notes, aren't designed to fulfil all of our needs. They aren't perfect substitutes for meeting up face-to-face, for instance. They also may not be available to people who cannot easily afford them. But for those who can and do play them, games offer some respite.\n\"This is about meeting people where they are,\" says Prof Przybylski. \"It's not a panacea.\"\nAnother gamer who has sought distraction in virtual worlds is Sarisha Goodman, an education and sociology student at the University of Birmingham, who is currently living back at home in London.\n\"When I was a teenager I just always went to gaming when I was really overwhelmed, so that's kind of what I've been doing,\" she explains.\nHer games of choice are The Sims 4 and Animal Crossing. She says she could play The Sims until 03:00 most days if she wanted to. It's a simulation game that allows the player to create characters and furnish their homes. You can then observe how those characters interact with one another.\n\"We don't have that normal life any more, it's nice to see it even if it's in a game form,\" says Ms Goodman. Sometimes, she uses the smartphone app House Party to simultaneously talk to friends online while she plays.\nAs a student in her third year, Ms Goodman hasn't had time to play games for months. Now she is glad of them. She has watched some online lectures for her course, and is starting work on her dissertation. But besides that, university life has more or less been put on hold. \nThere has been a noticeable uptick in gaming since Covid-19 started to spread, confirms Morris Garrard, at market analysis firm Futuresource.\n\"We're seeing particularly strong uptake in social games, games like Fortnite and Call of Duty: Warzone,\" he says.\nThe volume of games sold every week has risen by between 40% and 60%, and gamers are expected to spend significantly more time in games than last year, as a result of stay-at-home requirements. \nSimilar trends have been spotted in China, where Covid-19 was first detected. The mobile game Honor of Kings, for instance, clocked a 20% increase in revenue from in-game purchases during February, adds Mr Garrard.\nSteam, a PC game distribution service, recently counted 23.8 million gamers playing various games at the same time worldwide - the highest during Steam's 17-year history.\nThat's growth of roughly 15% in a fortnight says Tomas Otterbeck at Redeye AB, an investment bank.\nGames played online are also using more broadband data. US network Verizon reported a 75% increase in gaming traffic in mid-March.\n\"We can expect a 100% increase, compared to pre-Covid-19, in data usage since that report,\" says Mr Otterbeck.\nBut Prof Przybylski warns that, in such distressing times, people may need help beyond what virtual worlds can provide. Game companies should, he suggests, make it easy for troubled gamers to contact support services if needed.\n\"They need to put contact information for people who are in crisis onto their platforms,\" he explains. \"So when people need something that's not Animal Crossing, they can get to it.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-52230082": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-south-scotland-52230082", "title": "Coronavirus: Could gaming be good for you during lockdown?", "published": "Sun, 12 Apr 2020 09:34:43 GMT", "summary": "How much time should people spend playing games online - and could it offer some benefits during social isolation?", "story": "For gamers around the country, lockdown might appear to be an ideal opportunity to hone your skills in pretty much every waking moment.

is not to overdo it.\n\"Screentime guidance varies for age groups - but the key is to ensure a healthy balance across activities,\" he said.\n\"It's important for individuals to ensure a mix of physical activity, sedentary behaviour such as reading and screen time, and, of course, a good night's sleep.\n\"Isolation and lockdown in different circumstances will of course skew this, but it's important for people to try to maintain as much balance as possible.\"\nThere are a range of activities aimed at trying to persuade young people in particular to take a screen break.\nIn Dumfries and Galloway, the council's youth work team has sent out isolation packs which include old-school games like dominoes and playing cards.\nThe Wigtown Book Festival recently launched a writing competition for children from eight to 18.\nThe Scottish Book Trust is also encouraging us to get our pens out and contribute stories to a publication planned on the theme of \"future\".\nIn addition, fitness classes have gone online and are proving particularly successful.\nA recent festival in Dumfries highlighted the positive aspects of gaming and these could be particularly relevant while confined to your home for large parts of the day.\nDr Galloway said online gameplay allowed for \"communication and collaboration\" to achieve goals or compete with others.\n\"It easily replaces some of the activities that are no longer feasible due to social distancing and isolation,\" he said.\n\"It's very important for mental well-being to maintain relationships and contact with friends and family, and online games are an excellent method for facilitating this.\n\"The games themselves also create emergent outcomes and scenarios that create positive shared experiences, and memories for those engaged with them.\"\nHe said that meant they could have more impact than a video call and were \"a good replacement in the current circumstances\" for other forms of social interaction.\n\"Entertainment such as games and streaming services also help us pass the time and, more importantly, stay indoors - so this aspect is particularly helpful in the situation we are in,\" he added.\nThere are different potential benefits attached, according to the type of game being played.\nMinecraft, Sea of Thieves or Fortnite can help maintain social activity and encourage contact with your peer-group.\nDr Galloway said they boosted \"communication, creativity and collaboration\".\nOther games encourage physical activity, which is something we are being encouraged to maintain.\n\"It may be a good opportunity to dust off the Nintendo Wii for some Wii Sports,\" suggested Dr Galloway.\nPokemon Go, with social distancing, could be used on a daily exercise walk.\nBut it might also be time to go retro - but using technology to give it a twist.\n\"Raid the cupboard or pick up some traditional board games to have some fun with whoever you are under lockdown with,\" suggested Dr Galloway.\n\"Some games can also be played over video chats - if you are creative and promise not to cheat.\"\nBut above all, the recommendation is moderation for however long lockdown may continue.\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52222547": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52222547", "title": "Final Fantasy 7 Remake: 'This is not just for the players of the original'", "published": "Sat, 11 Apr 2020 00:06:47 GMT", "summary": "The original 1997 game sold more than 12 million copies and a 2020 remake has just been released.", "story": "Cloud Strife and his iconic mop of spiked blonde hair emerge through the rising steam of an overcrowded city.\nThe main character of Final Fantasy 7 has his distinctive buster sword strapped to his back.\nThis time, however, he's not a pixelated image as seen in the 1997 PlayStation original - he's been fully rendered in life-like modern graphics. \nIt's been five years since gamers got a first glimpse of the Final Fantasy 7 Remake, when the first trailer dropped.\nThe remake, which is out now, is a completely rebuilt version of a role-playing game that has sold more than 12 million copies worldwide.\nAnd fans of the original are excited to make a return to Midgar, the fantasy city where the remake takes place.\nOne of those eagerly awaiting the release is Youtuber Elz the Witch, who says she felt \"really emotional\" when she first played the remake.\n\"When the title screen came up with the theme music, it looked exactly how I imagined it looking 23 years ago, but with a hundred times better graphics,\" she tells BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat.\n\"I didn't expect to be emotional but it's just that nostalgia of something that you've wanted for so long -

Into the breach have stepped volunteers who are fighting to stop rumours, bad advice and conspiracy theories from going viral. \nRachael Hogg is currently juggling her busy job as a project manager and teaching her nine-year-old from her home in the market town of Morpeth, about 15 miles north of Newcastle. \nBut if that wasn't enough, each day she's also deleting as many as 50 misleading posts about coronavirus from the local Facebook group she runs. Morpeth Matters has 22,000 members - substantially more than the actual population of the town. The group's numbers are swelled by former residents and people from surrounding villages who turn to Facebook for local info.\n\"The group has been overwhelmed with scaremongering, speculation about what's in the supermarkets, conspiracy theories and misleading posts,\" Rachael explains after a long day of home-schooling and work around her kitchen table.\nIn normal times she'd be out socialising with friends or performing official business - she's a town councillor. But at the moment she's spending what she calls \"an unhealthy amount of time\" online. \n\"Somebody once said to me, if it's on Morpeth Matters, it must be true,\" she says. \"I think people are more likely to believe what's posted in local Facebook groups, because it seems to come from within their community.\"\nRachael has had to reject false posts about tanks on the streets of Newcastle, untrustworthy information about how the virus is spread and a questionable post attributed to an unnamed \"NHS worker\". That post contained a mix of accurate information and potentially panic-inducing phrases (\"do not leave home for bread or anything!\") that do not align with current guidelines.\nRachael says misleading information online has caused people in the town to rush out to supermarkets, panic their neighbours and inundate local schools with phone calls. \nVolunteer moderators like Rachael have stepped in as staffing at the big social media companies has been hit by coronavirus. \nFacebook says it's operating with a \"reduced and remote workforce\", so it is prioritising investigating the most harmful content. \nSimilarly, YouTube and Twitter are relying less on human moderators and more on automated flagging tools and artificial intelligence. \nWaqas Hussain, who was born and raised in Walthamstow in north-east London, is an accountant with four children. He's also a moderator of Walthamstow Residents NEWS, which has more than 28,000 members. \n\"Misleading posts are deleted and the debunking is posted,\" he says. \"No fake news allowed.\"\nWaqas says he feels \"a sense of duty to ensure only factual information gets published\", and so he investigates posts in a way that's not dissimilar to professional fact-checkers.\n\"I will spend some time looking up the facts and then do a long post about it. There is all sorts [of bad information] - posts about the seriousness of coronavirus, shops being fined and links from unscrupulous websites. All such posts are deleted as soon as I see them.\"\nThat includes YouTube videos being shared about a conspiracy theory which falsely links 5G to coronavirus. Proponents of the theory have been behind a rash of attacks on mobile phone infrastructure.\nIn between rounds of board games with his children, Waqas recently investigated a photo of a fake message claiming to be from the government and threatening fines if people leave their homes, even for essential goods. It too got deleted.\nAnother Facebook group, Swindon Community Notice Board, has more than 18,000 members. \nIt might have become a hotbed of misinformation were it not for its moderators, Debra Collins and Graham Stobbs. They say they reject around 150 misleading posts every single day.\nThe 49-year-olds usually run music events together. Army veteran Graham, who has post-traumatic stress disorder, is particularly busy since he's using his exercise time to train for a kayak challenge to raise money for a mental health charity.  \nBut at the moment, Debra and Graham say they are distracted \"all day every day\" by the group. Thousands of members have joined since the start of the pandemic. \n\"We work closely with our local authority and local MPs to ensure there is consistent and correct information shared,\" Debra says. \nA lot of the posts they reject are scaremongering \"from non-official sources which later turned out to be fake news,\" she says. \nA similar thing is happening in a local Facebook group in Stoke-on-Trent. \nA medical receptionist, who runs the group but asked not to be named because of her job, told BBC News that she's been stopping misleading medical information from reaching the rest of the group. \n\"One post encouraged everyone to try and get hold of inhalers used by asthma sufferers to combat the virus. This puts horrendous pressure on the NHS as patients call us requesting inhalers that are not only useless, but they are not entitled to be prescribed.\" \nA local GP surgery in the area even had to issue a statement because of the number of people contacting them after hearing false news on Facebook about fictional coronavirus \"rescue packs\".\nIn a crisis like this one, some people are trying to pitch in wherever they can - including in the fight against online misinformation. \n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52169444": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-52169444", "title": "Pixar pioneers behind Toy Story animation win 'Nobel Prize' of computing", "published": "Sat, 04 Apr 2020 23:07:17 GMT", "summary": "The men who made Toy Story and Finding Nemo possible speak to the BBC about their Turing Award win.", "story": "In the opening scene of Toy Story, released in 1995, a cluster of boxes is scattered across a child's bedroom. The sun streams into the room as a Mr Potato Head doll demands money from a seemingly stricken cast of plastic and plush toys outside a cardboard bank. \nInto the picture arrives the hero - a cowboy sheriff made of plastic and fabric with a pull-string to make him speak. The sheriff casts a shadow over the villainous potato who flees from the law. \nIt's a scene plucked from a child's imagination. It was also the culmination of decades of development in computer animation. \nThis year, two of the men behind those advancements, Ed Catmull and Pat Hanrahan, are the recipients of the Turing Award. The award recognises \"lasting and major\" contributions to the field of computing and is considered to be the \"Nobel Prize\" of computer science. \nThe award is given by the Association for Computing Machinery and comes with a $1m (\u00a3800,000) cash prize split between the winners. \nDr Catmull was one of the founders of Pixar, the studio behind Toy Story. Dr Hanrahan was one of Pixar's early employees.\nThe pair were notified of their win in early March. \nIt gave the two old friends and former colleagues just enough time to meet for a celebratory meal before coronavirus lockdown measures were put in place in California, where they both live.\n\"The digital revolution we have seen in all kinds of movies, television, games - probably no one made more of the difference to that then Ed and Pat,\" says David Price, author of the book The Pixar Touch. \nTo make Toy Story and other computer-animated films possible, Dr Catmull, Dr Hanrahan and their teams had to develop ways to get computers to visualise three-dimensional objects. \nDuring his postdoctoral studies, Dr Catmull created a way to make a computer recognise a curved surface. Once developers had a mathematically defined curved surface they could begin to add more features to it - such as texture and depth. \n\"Step by step you figure out what kind of lighting should be applied. Then you begin to put in the physics of it, because plastic reflects light one way and metal reflects it in a very different way,\" Dr Catmull explains. \nDr Catmull had always had an interest in animation and film. \nAfter earning his doctorate and working in a graphics lab in New York, he eventually became the head of computer division of Lucasfilm, founded by George Lucas. The creator of Star Wars and Jurassic Park saw the potential of computer animation in movies. \nBut Dr Catmull says his dream to make a feature-length computer-animated film was still seen as \"wildly impractical\".\n\"Most people dismissed the idea as an irrelevant pipe dream.\" \nIn 1986, Apple founder Steve Jobs came along. He bought Lucasfilm's computer division and turned it into a standalone company, Pixar. \nAt first, the firm tried to sell computer hardware.  When that failed to take off, Pixar refocused on computer imagery.\nDr Hanrahan was one of the company's earliest employees. He was put in charge of creating a minimum standard for the way computer code is used to describe images. \n\"Pixar was a magic place,\" says Dr Hanrahan who now teaches at Stanford University.  \nHe oversaw the creation of RenderMan - the software Pixar uses to create its 3D animations - working with teams from across the industry. \nCrucially, Dr Hanrahan worked out how to visualise how light reflects off different surface. On surfaces such as human skin, some of the light passes through or is absorbed. \nGetting this level of light and shade right gives images a more realistic look. \nRenderMan has been used to create animated films including Toy Story and Pixar's A Bug's Life. It was also essential for visual effects in live-action films including Terminator 2, Titanic and Jurassic Park. \nDevelopments in computer animation drove the video gaming industry as well as advancements in virtual and augmented reality. And its progress has been tied closely to advancements in machine learning. \nAccording to Dr Catmull,  sharing work across the industry and with other sectors allowed for the bigger breakthroughs, particularly processing power.\nComputers of the 1980s and 1990s had only a fraction of the processing power laptops and smartphones have today. \n\"[A lack of processing power] definitely was a limiting factor,\" Dr Catmull explains. \n\"You had to almost bide your time working on the algorithms for the compute power to catch up with the ideas that we had.\"\nBut even today, computer-animated films rely on small armies of animators.  \n\"It's a very labour-intensive process, we still have to do a lot of things manually,\" says Dr Hanrahan. \n\"If you just want to have a character walk around a world and have a human-like motion that makes you think it's natural, that's a huge problem\u2026 we have no idea how to do that well.\"\nDevelopments in robotics have helped to make improvements in this area, demonstrating how crucial it still is to share learning across fields.\nThough Steve Jobs was known as a very secretive leader at Apple, Dr Catmull says at Pixar he was far more open and understood the need to share innovations.\n\"Publishing was one of the things that helped us attract the best people.

For me it was about being at Leeds United and playing with that group of players and staff. \n\"It was magic.\"\nAlthough a member of the squad, Hunter did not play during England's triumphant 1966 World Cup campaign, with their central defensive partnership formed by Jack Charlton - his Leeds team-mate - and captain Bobby Moore.\nThe England national team said they were \"extremely saddened\" by Hunter's death and that \"all of our thoughts are with his family, friends and supporters\".\nAfter leaving Leeds in 1976, Hunter also played for Bristol City and Barnsley, managing the Tykes and Rotherham after he retired from playing.\nThe Professional Footballers' Association said: \"Football has lost a legend and we join the entire football community in mourning this loss.\"\n\"Enormously shocked and saddened to hear the awful news about my friend Norman Hunter, he will be very sadly missed. My heartfelt thoughts are with his wife, Sue, his family and the England and Leeds United fans, a huge part of the 1966-70 England squad back in the day.\"\nGrew up watching that great Leeds side of which Norman Hunter was a huge part. This awful virus was one crunching tackle too far but he'll be biting yer legs somewhere. RIP.\n\"Norman always had a laugh. He was very professional, a hard worker and someone who was good to have around in the squad.\n\"He was somebody you never liked playing against because he did let players know he was around. He was a great player. He had a lot more than just being a tough man.\"\n\"He loved Leeds like nothing else. It's incredibly sad that he won't get to see Leeds promoted back to the Premier League.\n\"His knowledge of football was immense. He could be critical of the players and the team but he did it in a charming way. He could be critical but never offended anybody.\"\n\"I was extremely privileged to sit next to Norman at a PFA awards a couple of years ago and he was one of the nicest, warmest and friendliest men I've met. He shared stories that were amazing to hear and was so kind to me and I was just a stranger.\"\n\"I worked with Norman Hunter at BBC Radio Leeds. I had four wonderful years with him, it was an absolute education.\n\"My condolences to his family. He was a gentle giant.

So what has he been up to?", "story": "It's 7.30 in the morning and an online news conference organised with Sebastian Vettel is a few minutes old when it dawns on the Ferrari driver that there are a large number of British journalists on the call.\n\"I just realised it's an hour behind in the UK, so it's even earlier there,\" he says with a smile. \"Sorry about that.\"\nThe four-time world champion is in his home in Switzerland, wood beams criss-crossing a white wall behind. He's wearing his team shirt; he doesn't reveal whether he still has his pyjama trousers on out of shot. But in the circumstances it seems unlikely.\n\"I like to start early so I have lots of time left in the day,\" he says. \"I'm planning on going for a little bike ride later.\"\nThis is the 'new normal' in Formula 1, now the start of the season has been laid waste by the coronavirus. No-one can race, and factories are on shutdown. The drivers are busying themselves staying fit and sharp, and the sport's bosses are trying to navigate a way through the crisis, but the oxygen of exposure remains as valuable now as ever. \nSome of Vettel's peers are satisfying their racing bug by taking the competition online - his Ferrari team-mate Charles Leclerc won a 'Virtual Grand Prix' a couple of weeks ago at his first attempt, and there is another one this weekend, on the date of what would have been the Chinese race.\nVettel, though, is a 32-year-old father of three pre-school kids, so he has plenty on his hands already. He is known for his old-style approach - he famously eschews social media - and has not been involved. At least not so far.\n\"The truth is I didn't have a simulator until a couple of days ago,\" he says, \"so I have not been tempted because I didn't have the chance. \n\"I have heard a lot of things about it. So I thought I would get one and try. Generally, I am not going to foresee a career in sim racing. It is more something to try for fun. I have been playing some games but since I had kids it is not the first thing on my list to do. \n\"I have read some of the news and I have also read Charles did well on his debut, but I still consider it a bit more of a fun thing. I am aware some people take it very seriously and spend a lot of time there but I also enjoy doing a lot of things.\"\nVettel, as ever, is thoughtful and intelligent as he considers the impact of the coronavirus, not just on F1 but on society at large.\n\"I miss driving, the sensation of driving; there is nothing that can replace that,\" he says. \"It is what we are all waiting for. (But) it gives you time to reflect. It is quite an intimate time with family. The circumstances are not nice but we are all trying to make the best out of it.\"\nIn the month since the Australian Grand Prix was cancelled on the eve of the first practice session in Melbourne, a lot has been going on behind the scenes in F1.\nThe sport's bosses have brought in a series of changes to help the sport weather what everyone knows will be a significant financial storm. And the drivers have also been discussing the way forward, through their umbrella group the Grand Prix Drivers' Association, of which Vettel is one of three directors.\nHe accepts that when F1 does finally return, it will likely be under very different circumstances.\n\"We have spoken about that a fair amount inside the GPDA,\" he says. \"It is a very difficult one. It is a tough decision. On the one hand, you have the health of the sport, if you look at it from the business aspect; on the other hand you have the responsibility to the people in the paddock and of course most importantly the fans.\n\"It is a sport that is carried out in the open but we have a lot of people who come to watch the races. We need to make sure as much as we are taking care of ourselves we are also taking care of the public. There are a lot of options we could have - whether it is without fans, whether it is with fans. \n\"Nobody likes to race in front of empty grandstands. It feels a bit odd. On the other hand, there is the question when is the right time to start racing again and whether a ghost race could be held a lot sooner than a race in the way we are used to it. \n\"We would all like get back to normal, not just for F1's sake, but for everyone's sake. But the best medicine will be to be patient. It is painful because I want to be back in the car and if I am selfish I want to race. But there are a lot of people who would like a lot of things. \n\"Probably at the beginning the first races will be compromised in terms of what we are used to. But hopefully not too much because we all want to race in front of crowds.\"\nIt is also likely that the season - assuming there is one - will be considerably shorter than intended. But Vettel says this should not be a reason to consider the championship devalued.\n\"I don't think it makes a big difference,\" he says. \"A season is a season whether it has 10, 20 or 25 races; you still have to be the most consistent. In the end, the championship is the championship. With 10 races, there would still be a lot of things to get right.\"\nThe uncertain state of the sport has other impacts, too. Most of the top drivers are out of contract at the end of this season, and Vettel is among them. Normally, decisions as to whether to move or stay would be influenced by how the season started, for both driver and team. Now, it is likely they will have to be taken before any racing has happened.\nEither way, Vettel says he not only wants to stay in F1 - but also to prolong his time at Ferrari, where Leclerc is already committed until 2024.\n\"I made that clear last time we spoke,\" he says. \"I don't know when that was.\" The car launch? \"Yeah, the launch.\"\nHe adds: \"Whatever the deal will be like, it is whatever I and the team will be comfortable with. In terms of duration, normally the contracts I had in the past were all a three-year deal. \n\"I am one of the more experienced drivers but I am not the oldest and I don't think there is an age limit in this regard. It will depend on what we feel comfortable with.\n\"There is a high chance we will have to make a decision before there is the first race, because at the moment it looks like there will be no race before June or even July. We are all waiting. But the main priority at first is to ensure we are all dealing in the right way with the situation. We will make progress, but I don't think there is a real timeline.\"\nOn a topic of more immediacy, he is asked whether he will take a pay cut this year, as a number of other drivers have.\n\"It is definitely something I am talking about with the team,\" he says. \"We don't know how the season will look and when it will start, but I have always kept whatever decision I made on this front with the team and myself and it will be the same this time. \n\"I am not keen to use this argument or point as a kind of image polish. What I have decided to do in the past I have done quietly and it will be the same right now.\"\nThe coronavirus has changed so much for so many people, and F1 drivers, while they might live in a rarefied world, are no different in finding it has taken some getting used to.\n\"The big change is we don't have a normal day and daily routine,\" Vettel says. \"Routines are good in life and sports is a way for most people to either exercise or to follow and to switch off and do something else. In this regard, it is very powerful. \n\"Normally one of the first things I check when I open the newspaper is the sports section. Now there is no news even if there are some interesting articles and time for reflection. \n\"It is a great time for all of us - not a great time, because the circumstances are rather sad - but a great time to reset and try to figure out what is really important for you. Hopefully these conclusions stick around for later.\"\n", "pic": "https://c.files.bbci.co.uk/09C4/production/_95900520_bensonnew.jpg"}, "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/52325279": {"link": "http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-union/52325279", "title": "Katy Daley-Mclean signs for Premier 15s newcomers Sale as player-coach", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 11:02:46 GMT", "summary": "England's World Cup-winning captain Katy Daley-Mclean signs for Premier 15s newcomers Sale Sharks Women as a player-coach.", "story": "World Cup-winning captain Katy Daley-Mclean has signed for Premier 15s newcomers Sale Sharks Women as a player-coach.\nThe 34-year-old fly-half, who has 114 England caps and captained the side to victory at the 2014 World Cup, joins from Loughborough Lightning.\nIn early April, Sale and Exeter Chiefs were given a place in the top flight of English women\u2019s rugby from next season. \n\"I'm really excited to join such a great club,\" Daley-Mclean said.\n\"And to be part of an ambitious women\u2019s programme from the outset.\"\nThe 2019-20 Premier 15s season was declared null and void because of coronavirus, with London sides Saracens and Harlequins first and second in the table.\nRichmond and Firwood Waterloo Ladies, who unlike Sale and Exeter are not linked to a men\u2019s Premiership side, lost their places in the league.\nDaley-Mclean added: \"Aligning with such a successful men\u2019s side, Sale Women have the opportunity and ambition to ultimately develop a side capable of competing with the dominant women\u2019s clubs in the South.

With an audience of 8.27 million, his is the most popular show in the UK - a particularly impressive accolade given that he doesn't host the breakfast show, traditionally a radio station's flagship programme.\nBruce is one of countless radio presenters currently broadcasting from home, but technical advances make this much easier than it used to be.\nMany listeners won't even have noticed a change - as was the case when the presenters of Radio 4's Today programme began broadcasting from home last month.\n\"It sounded so good that we've actually had some people calling in asking, 'Why is everybody in the same studio? They should be socially distancing',\" the BBC's director of radio and education, \n\"We've told [presenters] to explain [that they're at home] because actually the sound makes it seem like they're all in the same place, when they're very much not.\"\nFor the Today programme's male hosts, the familiar home environment has at least given them the ideal opportunity to start growing a beard.\n\"I admit I have embraced a slightly more relaxed approach to the morning,\" Justin Webb wrote this week in the Radio Times. \"I'm not shaving, largely to compete with Nick Robinson, who came back from a holiday last year looking like a Mills & Boon romantic hero.\"\nWherever the presenters are, radio is proving to be a valuable source of entertainment now many people are working from home.\n\"Radio does provide friendship, companionship, in an undemanding kind of way, so strong relationships are formed between listener and broadcaster on radio, and I think that will only increase as time goes on,\" Bruce says.\n\"We're certainly aware of more people listening and taking part in Popmaster, for example, than before, and the texts and emails have massively grown, so I think there will be a general rediscovery of radio and how important it can be at times like this.\"\nPetroc Trelawny, who hosts Radio 3's breakfast show, agrees there has been a surge in listening to music-based programmes as the public seek companionship and escapism from the news agenda.\n\"R3 listeners send several hundred emails, tweets and texts to Breakfast every morning, a significant percentage coming from those taking refuge from Today and news-based breakfast shows on 5 Live and LBC,\" \nBut there will be some delay before the industry can ascertain how big the increase in listening has been.\nLast month, industry body James Purnell, told Radio 4's Feedback. as collecting data from members of the public has been made trickier under lockdown.\nBruce embraces the benefits of working from home (which include being able to eat a slice of lemon drizzle cake during the 11 o'clock news bulletin). When lockdown restrictions are eventually lifted, will more DJs actively he said earlier this week. to continue broadcasting from home? \n\"There may be a slight move towards that. However I do know that there is something about being in a particular building, there's that sort of collegiate feeling of being at Radio 2 or wherever it is, and you take in the culture of the organisation almost by osmosis as you're in there,\" he says.\n\"You get to see everybody else or hear the gossip, not that that's important, but you get the general feel of what's going on while you're there.\"\nOne specific feature within Bruce's show which has seen a significant increase in engagement is the famous quiz broadcast at 10:30 every morning.\n\"We're hearing a lot about the Popmaster effect,\" says Bruce's producer Ricky Marshall.\n\"It's always been an appointment to listen, but I think now more than ever it's really ramping up - families are sitting down to do Popmaster, people are saying they're playing along with their friends on a Zoom call.\n\"The hashtag seems to trend most days with people all joining in together, so I think there's a real sense of online community around the quiz which is quite nice.\"\nPopmaster sees two callers face a series of (often quite difficult) music questions. If they hesitate for too long, a five-second countdown begins, which adds to the pressure.\n\"With the five-second counter, you've got to feel it,\" Bruce says. \"You don't play it too soon on the early questions, and if you think somebody might be getting a little Rajar told RadioToday it's reviewing ways it can continue monitoring listening habits, shall we say, then you can slam the five-second countdown clock down quite quickly. So it's a question of touch and feel.\"\nOn the unrelenting difficulty of the questions, Marshall says: \"It's fine if you hit that sweet spot of your era or your area, but some of the questions I look at and I don't have a clue. It's only worrying if Ken doesn't know the answer, then you know you're in trouble! He's generally seen it all over the years.\"\nBruce recently told the MediaMasters podcast he's only had one day off sick in the last 34 years, although there was one occasion where listeners may have noticed he didn't sound like his usual self.\nOn April Fools Day 2011, comedian Rob Brydon (whose impression of Bruce is uncanny) famously stood in for him - \nIf, God forbid, Bruce became ill himself in the next few months and had to take a few days off work, is there any chance Brydon could cover for him again?\n\"Well yes, I'm sure he could,\" Bruce laughs, \"but I don't think the BBC could afford him.\"\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52322691": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-52322691", "title": "Lee Konitz: Jazz saxophonist dies with coronavirus", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 09:21:13 GMT", "summary": "The prolific musician played on Miles Davis's landmark record Birth Of The Cool and dozens more.", "story": "Celebrated jazz musician Lee Konitz has died at the age of 92 after contracting Covid-19.\nThe saxophonist, who was known for his ground-breaking improvisational style, played with greats like Charles Mingus, Bud Powell and Ornette Coleman.\nBut he was perhaps best known as one of the musicians on Miles Davis's landmark album Birth Of The Cool.\nHis family confirmed to NPR he had died in New York from pneumonia related to the coronavirus. \nBorn 1927 in Chicago, Konitz studied clarinet early on, then switched to the alto saxophone, developing an individual style characterised by a willingness to take daring harmonic risks.\nHis uninflected tone set him apart from the dominant style of the 1950s, established by Charlie Parker - who he counted as a close friend.\n\"I knew and loved Charlie Parker and copied his bebop solos like everyone else,\" Konitz told The Wall Street Journal in 2013. \n\"But I didn't want to sound like him.

His best-known piece, Subconscious-Lee, was an improvisation on Cole Porter's What Is This Thing Called Love.\nEnd of Youtube post  by studiosoundworks\n\"That's a technique I just picked up along the way from whoever invented it, whether it was Bird [Charlie Parker] or whoever,\" he told Downbeat in 2017. \n\"I consider it equivalent in some way to adding homemade lyrics to a melody that you could deliver the standard changes on. But then you change them somehow.

Are you kidding?'\"\nThe Hertfordshire singer found himself pigeon-holed as a protest singer after his first album arrived in 2017, crammed full of lyrics about transgender suicide, xenophobic media reporting, and corruption in FIFA.\nThe topics may have been weighty, but songs were a sun-soaked and effervescent brand of indie-pop, helping the teenager rack up an impressive 230 million streams and 200,000 sales in the UK alone. \nWhen the time came to record a follow-up, however, he railed against his reputation as \"the voice of Generation Z\".\n\"You get a bit cynical about the music you've been making and you want to make something super-expansive and crazy,\" he says.\nThe result is Zeros, an album that puts politics aside to tell a story of human fallibility in the face of an existential crisis - which could be environmental catastrophe, technological dystopia, or any number of looming disasters.\nWith one foot in the real world and the other in science-fiction, the record froths with ideas, from the Bowie-esque pop opera of Be An Astronaut to the foreboding Rapture, with its ominous computerised refrain: \"Jet black, jet black.\"\nThe lyrics are intentionally more abstract (McKenna calls them \"hyper-surreal\") allowing the listener to put their own spin on the stories... and hopefully sparing him the same old questions.\n\"I spend more time thinking about the music than I do the lyrics, by a long way,\" he explains, \"but I always end up talking about one buzzword to describe a song which had a whole story.

Even though it predates the coronavirus lockdown, the song feels oddly appropriate as communities around the world rally in support of one another.\n\"Responsibility is key at this point in time,\" he says, \"because we don't know what the future is going to look like and we have to be responsible.\"\nA few weeks before the lockdown took hold, McKenna sat down with the BBC to discuss his new album, which has now been postponed from a planned release in May to 21 August.\nNot in the slightest. I mean there's definitely an influence, but I definitely didn't want to make anything that sounded too country or Americana.\nYes! It's basically this technique I stole from St Vincent, called 'glam tuning' where all of the strings are tuned to the same note and I'm basically just slamming the whole guitar. It's pretty cool. \n[\n] You're always stealing! I like to think our brains are a bit like algorithms. Whatever you give it and feed it, you get out the product. It's the fun of creativity, piecing together what you know and making something new.\nupsets me when people say i\u2019m ripping of Bowie, cause I\u2019m ripping off St Vincent too and you need to start putting some respect on her name\nEnd of Twitter post  by @DeclanMcKenna\nThat comes from all the different stages of recording. I started out at home on a laptop, then I demoed the songs with a band, then we actually recorded the album in Nashville. So the songs developed as we went on. \nWhen I started out, I wrote Brazil on a loop pedal. I was a looper: That was how I performed and how a lot of my music was written. I don't think I used it at all on the new record. I was trying to step away from that and say, \"Can I write the song on a single instrument and just let it grow?\"\nOther times, I was writing quite digitally again, where it's a bit groove-based, it's a little bit of playing around. I don't have the longest attention span, so I had to find new ways to get myself excited to write songs!\nI would put \"\n\" just because I love that lyric. I wrote it with my friend Jake who was really interested in the sci-fi /real life attitude of the album. He started throwing all these weird, space western ideas at me.\nIt's true because the songs, at their core, are so sad, but with all the production, the groove, they're quite fun. \nYeah, destruction was on my mind the whole process of the record. I was constantly thinking, \"Wow, we have no idea where we're going to end up in a couple of years time and it's terrifying\".\nI don't know. I was thinking a lot about escapism. It can make or break you - like, if your escape is going out and getting pissed all the time, it's not conducive. But if you find your own ways to switch off that allow you to still have quality time and still enjoy yourself, then I think escapism is important.\nThere's a lot of people doing it accidentally, on social media, I think. That whole world is leading to a very isolated and strange existence that we don't really yet understand.\nIt's odd. It's not enriching your life in any way. It almost stunts your day. \nA prime example for me work-wise is in the studio. When you're just sitting there and you're peaceful and thinking about the record, those are the moments you tie things together and think, \"Oh, this is how we'll make it loads better\". Whereas if you're on your phone you're zoned out and you don't have that. \nBut it's an awkward one for me, because I love loads of internet culture and love being on my phone - but it's very hard to get the balance because it's an addictive tool. \nI just try and put the phone away.\nI pretty much do, to be fair. Like when we were in Nashville, I knew we had a couple of weeks and that was pretty much it, so I was really focused. When I'm at home it's a different story. \nMy friend introduced me to this account called Knobs which is very aesthetically-pleasing videos about guitar pedals, so I've been watching a lot of guitar pedal reviews! \nUhhh, it depends. I have to really convince myself to buy something online. If I'm in a guitar shop and I'm playing a pedal, it's very hard not to [take it home]. \nOn the record, there's a pedal called the Judder by MWFX which makes this chopped-up guitar sound - \n - and I just got obsessed with it. \nEnd of Youtube post 2 by DeclanMcKennaVEVO\nYeah, that whole aggressive engine-like synth sound. It's a big, intimidating thing but the lyrics are quite simple, so I think the sound carries the idea.\nThere's a lot of dread involved. My generation has a lot of very anxious young people. It's so intense and it's so draining to see an ISIS beheading followed by a cat meme. [In the end] you're not feeling things in the same way that you might have reacted prior to the internet - either to the hilarious or the terrible. You might have a stronger reaction when there's not so much of it. \nNo. Music still moves me. I'm very romantic about it. I don't know why I need music, I just do, and that's what I love. \nFacebook\n@BBCNewsEnts\n", "pic": "https://static.bbc.co.uk/news/1.312.03569/img/brand/generated/news-light.png"}, "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52299780": {"link": "https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/newsbeat-52299780", "title": "What happened next to Millionaire cough cheats?", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 07:30:00 GMT", "summary": "From reality TV to separate fraud charges, the Ingrams were busy after the events of ITV's drama quiz.", "story": "If you've been watching ITV's hit lockdown drama Quiz this week, you'll know why we're asking this:three-part drama Quiz What did Charles and/or Diana Ingram do after their conviction for trying to cheat TV's biggest quiz show out of \u00a31m?\nAnswer (for no money at all) - all of them.\nIf you don't remember 2001 then you need to get up to speed on Hear'Say, DJ Otzi and Emma Bunton's solo career. You've also been given a new chance to learn about a remarkable moment in British TV history - the story of how a couple from Wiltshire cheated their way to a fortune on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire. Back then, before Netflix and Amazon Prime, 19 million people would regularly tune in for the game show.\nThe new chance comes in the form of #stillgamequiz, which is based around the show and - most importantly - the three people found guilty of conspiring to cheat: Charles and Diana Ingram and a man they'd never met, Tecwen Whittock.\nThe third and final part of the series centred on their court case - they were found guilty but got suspended jail sentences so didn't go to prison.\nThe claim was Diana Ingram and Whittock coughed from the audience to help Charles Ingram answer the 15 questions correctly. Coughing was funnier in 2001 than it is in 2020. \nBut what has happened to the Ingrams in the 17 years since that world famous court case? Well, they now live in Bath selling custom jewellery, and Charles Ingram tweets a lot about Brexit - but there's a lot more to say...\nAnd went back on ITV to say so - onto This Morning, in fact. \nA barely grey Phillip Schofield was presenting even then and he went in hard with the questions - but Charles Ingram wouldn't budge: \"I should make one thing clear and I'll only say it once and then move on. We didn't cheat on that show. There was no plan to cheat on that show. I won that money perfectly honestly and fairly and squarely.\"\nA few months after the ITV court case, Charles Ingram appeared on his own in front of another jury in an unrelated case. He was found guilty of insurance fraud. The jury was told that the Millionaire case had left Ingram \u00a3400,000 in debt and he had no job.\nIf you remember Wife Swap, do you remember the Ingrams on Wife Swap? Charles Ingram paired up with Jade Goody. Her partner then was Jeff Brazier so he partnered with Diana. \nThe former Army major living with someone made famous by Big Brother didn't start well but seemed to improve after some blazing rows. Jade tried to give him a makeover, famously saying: \"If a tracksuit's good enough for David Beckham, it's good enough for you.\"\nDiana and Jeff got on slightly better and seemed to enjoy their night knocking back tequila at Bubbleglam in Romford. \nA lot of people seem to be forgetting the best bit of tv Charles Ingram was ever on was Celebrity Wife Swap with Jade Goody  pic.twitter.com/FjWixB5pme \nEnd of Twitter post  by @slaterscandal\nAnother big quiz of the noughties was BBC1's Weakest Link. The Ingrams tried a \"celebrity\" edition of that together. It also featured Lisa from Steps and Anton Du Beke from Strictly Come Dancing. A reminder, this was the noughties. \nOne of their questions on this show was: \"In classical music, what is the act of throat clearing that members of the concert audience are traditionally asked to try to avoid?\" You know the answer. They did too. \nThis is revealed in the podcast Final Answer, which is about the making of Quiz. \nDan Winch, one of the executive producers, says: \"We met the Ingrams towards the end of filming. They talk about it like it could have happened yesterday. It's affected their life in such a way that they have never really been able to break away from much of the impact of it.\"\nProducer Alice Pearse is also on the podcast. She adds: \"We were sensitive and mindful that this story is quite painful for those who lived through it. We spoke to people on every side of the story - the Ingrams, the ITV side, Celador and the lawyers on the prosecution and defence.

Fighting boredom by dropping dance moves, if the video for his new single, Toosie Slide, is anything to go by.\nBeyond showing the rapper taking isolation seriously, donning a face mask and gloves while staying home like so many of us (admittedly from his astronomically large Toronto pad) it also introduces the track's namesake dance routine. \n\"\n\" he sings, while demonstrating the moves in his lobby.\nSeemingly harmless fun - but for Maddy Raven of digital music marketing agency Burstimo, it doubles as a \"fantastic\" social media marketing ploy.\nDrake's simple, easily-copied choreography is perfect for the new wave of video-based social media platforms, in particular Tik Tok.\nEnd of Youtube post  by DrakeVEVO\nThe Chinese-owned social media app, in which users create 15-second clips, usually set to music, was second only to WhatsApp in global downloads last year. \nWith a billion users of its international version, it's increasingly established itself as a way for unknown artists to score a breakout hit - from Lil Nas X's Old Town Road, to Doja Cat's Say So and Arizona Zervas's Roxanne - in the same way that featuring in a television advert could supercharge an artist's sales in the pre-internet era. \n\"TikTok's an entirely new way of engaging, not only with your direct fanbase but anyone who wants to dance or show their creativity in short-form video,\" says Sammy Andrews, CEO of Deviate Digital, an advisory agency to the entertainment industry.\nEnd of Youtube post  by Best TikTok Compilations\nDrake himself alluded to this in December's single, War, chastising rappers who \"'Kiki challenge' of summer 2018 [Instagram] fragmented consumption habits.\"\nShortly after he took his own advice, messaging internet-famous dancer Toosie a beat with some lyrics, and asking for help creating a routine. Four months on, the song has topped Billboard charts.\nThe star is no stranger to viral dance recognition. His awkward moves in the video for 2015's Hotline Bling spawned endless memes, while the track In My Feelings inadvertently sparked the one of their generation's most influential musicians. The Toosie slide, however, is noticeably more transparent about its ambitions.\nRaven believes this is a dance partnership of self-interest, capitalising on Drake's dance pop-culture heritage, and taking new music directly to his young fanbase.\nThe majority of TikTok's users are aged between 16-24, firmly Gen Z - an audience with absorbed lip-syncing app Musical.ly, who rank Drake as country-crossover smash.\nDance is also central to the platform's success - with routines like The Get Down, Renegade and Cannibal all going viral since  parent company ByteDance Nas X told Time magazine last year, (plus its huge database), in 2017.\nAdd to this TikTok's unique layout, which prioritises content discovery over subscriber clout, using an algorithm that learns from viewing preferences and therefore rewards retention rather than simply pushing popular content - and it's a stage that even a megastar like Drake, now 33, can't ignore.\n\"This is a new frontier for music discovery and music interaction,\" says Andrews. \"Unlike many other apps people are actively seeking music to engage with, in ways that most have not on other platforms\".\nToosie Slide is a \"perfect example\" of writing specifically for the platform says Raven. \"Its straightforward lyrics provide clear instructions for a potential dance trend, even if it isn't publicly stated\".\nAnd it's a tactic that appears to be paying off. Two days after the video's release, views of Tik Tok entries submitted under the #toosieslide hashtag had already hit 20 million. A fortnight later, the tag has been viewed 2.4 billion times (including three attempts by Justin Bieber). That's a lot of eyes and ears by anyone's standards.\n\"Make no mistake every record label in the world is now actively looking for ways to utilise TikTok as part of a marketing campaign for a track,\" says Andrews.\nThe hungry marketing push is part of a broader picture, as TikTok traction can often be a springboard for further success on mainstream music streaming platforms like Spotify and Apple Music.\nJust last month The Weeknd's Blinding Lights started trending on TikTok and is \"now chart-topping and one of his most streamed songs,\" explains Raven, helping him reach 64 million monthly listeners on Spotify for the first time in his career.\nEnd of Youtube post  by TheWeekndVEVO\nOne of the most famous examples of TikTok's potential snowball effect is Nas X's Old Town Road. Prior to becoming a global Quarantine Cutie video series with Billy Rae Cyrus, the rapper's original version broke out on TikTok, with creators playing it in their videos as they transformed themselves into cowboys and cowgirls.\nIts continued success saw Nas X go from a college dropout sleeping on his sister's floor to instigating a major label bidding war, ultimately signing to Columbia Records.\n\"I should maybe be paying TikTok,\" the official video. \"They really boosted the song.\"\nLow-fi rapper Powfu has found similar viral success with his heartfelt, introspective track Death Bed (Coffee For Your Head), becoming a soundtrack to the lockdown.\nIt found popularity thanks to the music's biggest money maker, which sees a man pull out all the stops to win over a girl he sees through the window while self-isolating, and has since spread across the internet.  \nAfter accumulating more than 100 million plays on various YouTube clips, recent Rolling Stone investigation, released on 1 April, has already been viewed nine million times. \nThe bottom line of all this increased engagement is of course financial, with streaming now Facebook.\n\"We use TikTok as a means to first get the attention on the artist and ears on the music\" explains Raven. TikTok's algorithm remains a closely-guarded secret, but a @BBCNewsEnts suggested royalties are paid per video upload containing the track - making a viral dance routine a standalone goldmine.\nFurther royalties then come \"when the consumer is pushed to streaming platforms or the track gets enough traction to be played on radio rotation,\" she says.\nAndrews is even aware of \"some artists and labels changing the name of their tracks post-release if they've sparked mass fan uploads and dances on TikTok under other names to make them easily identifiable on streaming services\".\nThere is, however, a looming concern that this could create a tsunami of commercial content - ultimately clawing the community's power away from organic creators and saturating the platform with big names and major corporations trying to go viral.\nSo where does Toosie Slide leave Drake? As a cultural behemoth of the last decade, is it a sign of the rapper adapting to new trends, or a superstar selling out his musical integrity to stay relevant?\nPotentially both suggests Thomas Hobbs, a freelance music writer for Pitchfork and NME among others.\n\"Rappers can't ignore the boom of TikTok and I believe this single was designed to tap into that, more than quarantine.

The PHE announcement on Friday evening came shortly after the planned move was revealed by the Guardian. Meanwhile:\nThe government confirmed that 1bn items of personal protective equipment (PPE) were to have been delivered across the UK by this weekend \u2013 but hospitals and care homes continued to suffer shortages, in particular of gowns. More than 50 frontline healthcare workers have died amid fears a lack of PPE is leaving them exposed.\nProf Keith Willett, who has been leading NHS England\u2019s response to the coronavirus crisis, helped formulate the new PHE guidance, which is being sent to all 217 trusts in England.\nIt sets out options for what frontline staff should do when they cannot access gowns. They include hospitals that still have gowns lending each other batches of them, wearing coveralls \u2013 one-piece items of personal protective equipment (PPE) that cover the whole body \u2013 and using plastic aprons as alternatives.\nIt confirms that wearing \u201cdisposable, non-fluid-repellent gowns/coveralls with a disposable plastic apron for high-risk settings and aerosol-generating procedures [such as intubation] with forearm washing once gown/coverall is removed\u201d is one of the alternatives staff should deploy once gowns run out.\nA source had told the Guardian: \u201cThe new guidance will say \u2018this is what you do if you don\u2019t have any gowns\u2019. Wear an apron instead \u2013 that will be the new policy for the foreseeable future, though the medical organisations will go mad about that.\u201d\nGowns are vital for frontline staff dealing with Covid-positive patients because, alongside an FFP3 face mask, visor or goggles and two pairs of gloves, they make up the full PPE which PHE says is necessary to minimise the risk of infection from intubating patients being put on a ventilator.\nAdvising staff to use aprons instead of gowns carries the risk of a major confrontation with staff groups. \n that nurses should refuse to treat patients if they were not happy that the level of PPE available would protect them properly. The British Medical Association, which represents doctors, has also warned that doctors\u2019 lives are being put at risk by stocks of PPE having reached \u201cdangerously low levels\u201d.\nShortages of gowns in hospitals in England are far worse than Matt Hancock, the health secretary, has admitted, hospital bosses claim. \u201cWe are tight on gowns. That is the pressure point at the moment,\u201d Hancock told MPs on the Commons health and social care select committee in an evidence session on Friday morning.\nHe said: \u201cWe have another 55,000 gowns arriving today and we\u2019re working on the acquisition internationally of more gowns, but it is a challenge. This follows changing the guidance 10 days ago which increased the advice on the use of gowns but also said that they should be used for sessional use rather than for individual patient use ... And it is a big challenge delivering against that new guidance and we\u2019re doing everything we possibly can.\u201d\nHe could not guarantee that every hospital would have the supplies needed to tide it over this weekend.\nHancock had sought to reassure MPs by stressing that 55,000 more gowns were due to arrive on Friday. However, those equate to about eight hours\u2019 supply because the NHS is currently using 150,000 gowns a day.\nThere were only \u201cseveral tens of thousands\u201d left in the NHS\u2019s reserve stockpile, sources said on Friday. \u201cGowns have in effect already run out,\u201d one said. \u201cThe situation is so serious that some trusts will run out today and others over the weekend.\u201d\nEd Davey, the acting leader of the Liberal Democrats, warned that PHE\u2019s downgrading of the advice on PPE could result in more lives lost. \u201cChanging official guidance on protective equipment from gowns to aprons translates to increased risk to frontline staff, at a time when the death toll from Covid-19 is already rising for frontline workers. This is intolerable,\u201d he said.\n\u201cThe health secretary\u2019s repeated reassurances the supply of protective kit for staff was under control now look totally threadbare. Matt Hancock should have been completely candid about the level of personal protective equipment but is now fast losing the public\u2019s confidence as the reality of severe shortages becomes clear.\u201d\nAt least 50 doctors, nurses, midwives, porters and other NHS staff have \n, the Guardian has established.\nPHE is braced for a backlash from medical and nursing organisations. However, some senior figures in NHS England were \u201cexasperated\u201d about PHE\u2019s earlier stipulation that staff in high-risk Covid-19 environments should wear full PPE, including a gown, and regarded that as \u201cexcessive\u201d.\nNHS leaders and Hancock have been desperately trying to find a solution to the lack of gowns since the Guardian first \n last week an internal memo from NHS bosses warning hospital chiefs that \u201cthere are no immediate stocks of gowns due in the national supply chain over the next few days and we are unsighted on when further deliveries will be made\u201d.\nMore than a week later, they have been forced to draw up the controversial new guidance, which is a tacit admission that shortages are set to continue.\nNHS Providers, which represents trusts, said hospitals would implement the new guidance. \u201cThe supply of clinical gowns is now critical, and it is now clear that some trusts will run out of fully fluid-repellent gowns,\u201d it said.\nSaffron Cordery, the organisation\u2019s deputy chief executive, said: \u201cTrusts and the National Strategic Reserve have very carefully managed the last remaining stock and trusts have helped each other wherever possible. They have used the remaining stock of coveralls as alternatives to gowns and have been deploying their gown stock very carefully.\n\u201cWe understand the new recommendations \u2026 are aligned with World \n Organization guidance on the use of PPE when it is in short supply.\n\u201cTrust leaders will now implement this plan wherever needed and will therefore use the highest possible level of alternative protection equipment such as a fluid-retardant, as opposed to fluid-repellent, gown combined with an apron.\u201d\nThe British Medical Association (BMA) said using aprons instead of gowns would increase the risks run by frontline staff. Dr Rob Harwood, chair of the BMA\u2019s consultants committee, said: \u201cThe health and social care secretary admitted he couldn\u2019t guarantee that supplies of gowns wouldn\u2019t run out this weekend, and now this illustrates the dire situation that some doctors and healthcare workers are finding themselves in.\n\u201cIf staff are now told to use aprons in the place of gowns, this directly contravenes the evidence and guidance from both Public Health England and the World Health Organization. Guidance that\u2019s there to help keep healthcare workers and their patients out of harm\u2019s way.\n\u201cToo many healthcare workers have already died. More doctors and their colleagues cannot be expected to put their own lives on the line in a bid to save others, and this new advice means they could be doing just that. It\u2019s not a decision they should have to make.\u201d\nA spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social care said:\n\u201cNew clinical advice has been issued today to make sure that if there are shortages in one area, frontline staff know what PPE to wear instead to minimise risk. This has been reviewed by the Health and Safety Executive, and is in line with WHO and CDC guidance on PPE use in exceptional circumstances.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns", "title": "NHS staff asked to treat coronavirus patients without wearing gowns", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 17:52:03 GMT", "summary": "<p><strong>Exclusive:</strong> Hospitals across England to run out of supplies of the protective garments within hours</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>NHS bosses have asked doctors and nurses to work without protective full-length gowns when treating Covid-19 patients, as hospitals came within hours of running out of supplies.</p><p>The guidance is a reversal of <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/wuhan-novel-coronavirus-infection-prevention-and-control/covid-19-personal-protective-equipment-ppe\">Public Health England (PHE) guidelines</a> stipulating that full-length waterproof surgical gowns, designed to stop coronavirus droplets getting into someone\u2019s mouth or nose, should be worn for all high-risk hospital procedures.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/nhs-staff-to-be-asked-to-treat-coronavirus-patients-without-gowns\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e5865240fd3ca830a550708c407dd9d210155fcc/0_0_3500_2101/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=80f3ae69b9f6defa925f1dac2c66aa75"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/new-uk-taskforce-to-help-develop-and-roll-out-coronavirus-vaccine": {"story": "The government has announced a new vaccines taskforce to help the development of a vaccine for Covid-19 and ensure its rapid production and rollout if one arrives.\nThe business secretary, \n, also gave details of cash grants for work into both vaccines and potential treatments.

Clinical experts agree that the most dangerous phase is week two. Then patients generally start to recover. But some precipitously crash, as the virus attacks the lungs.\nBy 2 April, doctors were worried that in Johnson\u2019s case, the infection was taking this second, ominous path. St Thomas\u2019 hospital \u2013 just across the Thames from Downing Street \u2013 began making preparations to admit the prime minister.\nAccording to one source, staff were told his condition was significantly worse than had been publicly admitted \u2013 really bad, in fact. And that he was likely to need oxygen support.\nInside Downing Street, Johnson was in contact with his principal private secretary, Martin Reynolds, and his GP. Many of his usual advisers were themselves off sick, with Dominic Cummings \n and the director of communications, Lee Cain, away. As Johnson\u2019s condition steadily worsened, phone calls were cut down, government papers trimmed. His approach to his illness was characteristically upbeat: he would vanquish it.\nStories of Johnson\u2019s decline were now circulating among Tory backbenchers and journalists. Downing Street insisted these whispers were wrong. In hindsight, this guidance seems misleading.\nThe rumours were loosely right: the prime minister was seriously unwell, more than admitted. Perhaps Johnson was minimising how bad he was feeling, even to those in his inner circle? \nAt 8pm that evening the \n, to clap for NHS workers. He looked terrible.\nThe next day, Friday 3 April, Johnson recorded a video in which he urged the public to stay at home during the forthcoming sunny weekend. He said he still had a temperature and was staying in isolation. It was day eight.\nIn fact, Johnson was sinking in classic Covid-19 fashion.\nBy the weekend it was becoming clear to the few in contact with him that the prime minister was struggling to do his job. On Saturday 4 April, Johnson\u2019s fiancee, Carrie Symonds \u2013 pregnant \n with coronavirus symptoms \u2013 grew agitated, friends said, crying down the phone. Hancock claimed all was well, telling Sky News on Sunday morning the prime minister was \u201cworking away\u201d and had his \u201chand on the tiller\u201d.\nIn reality, Johnson\u2019s breathing had deteriorated. On Sunday afternoon the plan to admit Johnson to St Thomas\u2019 was rebooted. That evening he was driven across the Thames and taken to a private room on the 12th floor. Downing Street did not deny reports he was immediately given oxygen. Once again, his spokesman sought to downplay events, \n. The consultant in charge of the prime minister\u2019s care was Dr Richard Leach, the clinical director of the hospital\u2019s pulmonary team and a leading lung expert.\nThe following day, Monday 6 April, things took an almost Soviet turn. While the prime minister was gasping for breath, aides insisted at a lunchtime press briefing that he was busy working his way through red boxes.\nAt 5pm the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, even claimed Johnson was in charge and \u201cleading\u201d. Asked when he had last spoken to him, however, Raab replied it had been Saturday.\nIt appeared the government was covering up, or incompetent, or both. (No 10 says when Raab spoke he was unaware of his boss\u2019s sudden decline.)\nOn Monday afternoon the prime minister\u2019s condition \n. A decision was made to transfer him to one of St Thomas\u2019 two intensive care units. Johnson was put in a side room, on the east wing\u2019s first floor. The development stunned Downing Street.\nAt 8.10pm it announced the prime minister was in critical care, saying he had asked Raab to deputise for him. The fiction of Johnson being in command had ended. World leaders and politicians \n. His aides were knocked over, distraught.\nTypically, Covid-19 patients in ICU are put on ventilators. This is an invasive and traumatic process. Some hospitals prefer to treat severe cases with a continuous positive airway pressure ventilator (Cpap). St Thomas\u2019, however, favours full ventilation, believing this is how you save people, specialists say.\nOne source inside the hospital said Johnson was \u201cvery sick\u201d when taken into ICU. \u201cIt was touch and go whether he would be put on a ventilator,\u201d the source said.\nThe same source, however, wonders whether the prime minister really should have been in intensive care.\nAbout 130 other patients were in critical care at the time, the vast majority hooked up to ventilators. At no point was Johnson on a ventilator. Nor did he receive Cpap, a less invasive form of treatment.\nThe source said: \u201cBefore the coronavirus crisis you could be in ICU without being on a ventilator but pretty much every bed is now taken by a coronavirus patient with a ventilator. I know people who work in ICU and I know the technicians who prepare all the equipment and they all say he was not put on a ventilator. He was taking up an ICU bed when he didn\u2019t need it. The idea that you would put a patient who didn\u2019t need a ventilator on an ICU bed is nonsense.\u201d\nWeighed against this was the fact that Johnson \u2013 who is 55 \u2013 fitted the pattern of other serious male cases. As a second source put it bluntly: \u201cThey have a very low threshold for people of his profile (over 50, fat). If they don\u2019t get a tube in early it makes it much harder to do later on, if he deteriorates further.\u201d\nBack in Whitehall, a new protocol for briefing on the prime minister\u2019s health was set up. Only limited updates from St Thomas\u2019 would be passed on. Johnson was \n, No 10 said.\nOn Wednesday 8 April there was tentative good news. Johnson was still not on a ventilator. \u201cIf they don\u2019t go on one in the first 48 hours of being in ICU it\u2019s usually a good sign,\u201d the second source said. At the daily briefing the chancellor, Rishi Sunak, revealed the prime minister was \n. According to hospital insiders, he was reverting to his old self. \u201cHe\u2019s charming all the nurses, insisting they call him \u2018Boris\u2019,\u201d one reported.\nAfter three days in intensive care he was \n. Downing Street said he was in extremely good spirits and \u201cenormously grateful\u201d for the care he\u2019d received.\nSymonds tweeted a painting of a rainbow with 26 clapping emojis. There were grim questions still, such as how long would his recuperation last and had the virus caused long-term damage to his health and lung capacity?\nBy Easter weekend Johnson was keen to go home. His medical team counselled caution. According to one source they advised him to stay in a little longer, until 14 April. Johnson prevailed.\nAt midday on Sunday, \n, following seven nights in hospital, three of them in intensive care.\nHours later, Johnson appeared in a video message sent from Chequers, his prime ministerial retreat in Buckinghamshire. It was vintage Johnson. Dressed in a suit and tie, he declared the NHS had saved his life \u201cno question\u201d.\nHe \n who had watched over him for 48 hours in intensive care when \u201cthings could have gone either way\u201d \u2013 Jenny from New Zealand and Luis from Portugal. He said their care was \u201cthe reason in the end my body did start to get enough oxygen\u201d.\nJohnson had experienced a scare, no doubt about that.\nOne specialist said he thought the prime minister had gilded the lily a bit \u2013 \u201cI suspect there\u2019s been an element of poetic licence there\u201d \u2013 but at the same time stressed that he did need oxygen, albeit through a face mask rather than Cpap or full mechanical ventilation.\nThe specialist did not begrudge Johnson being put into ICU, reasoning \u201che\u2019s the prime minister\u201d, and \u201cwithout that oxygen he would not have got better\u201d.\nThe saga had a curious footnote.\nPhotographs taken from a public footpath showed Johnson and Symonds walking with their dog in the grounds of Chequers, the prime minister bundled up in a duffle coat and gloves. He looked pale but well enough to go for a stroll. Most ICU patients leave hospital in a wheelchair. They suffer from exhaustion, muscle wastage and other chronic problems. The prime minister appears to be in much better shape.\nJohnson won the 2016 EU referendum by combining \n \u2013 the UK\u2019s unofficial religion \u2013 with soft nationalism and Brexit.\nWhatever mistakes have been made over the pandemic, Johnson now has another winning political formula to silence his critics: without the NHS I wouldn\u2019t be here.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/boris-johnson-and-coronavirus-inside-story-illness", "title": "Boris Johnson and coronavirus: the inside story of his illness", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 12:31:16 GMT", "summary": "<p>Saga of rumours, denials and admissions took the nation on an emotional rollercoaster</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The rumours began a week after Boris Johnson began self-isolating in the flat above No 11 Downing Street.

We need to ensure we need to keep the public\u2019s minds focused on staying at home, protecting the NHS and saving lives.\u201d\nJohnson left St Thomas\u2019 hospital in central London five days ago following treatment for coronavirus, which included 48 hours in intensive care, and has since been at Chequers. He has been walking in the grounds, and joined Thursday evening\u2019s mass applause for NHS and care staff.\nThe spokesman said while Johnson had spoken once to Raab by phone, he was not receiving any official papers or talking to other world leaders: \u201cHe is continuing his recovery at Chequers, and he is not doing government work.\u201d\nAsked if the government should set out further details on how and when the lockdown could be eased, the spokesman stressed the need to continue to focus on social distancing.\n\u201cWe have set out the five tests which we believe need to be met in order for us to be able to consider relaxing some of the social distancing measures that are in place,\u201d he said.\n\u201cBut we are at a critical point in our response to this pandemic and we do want people to remain focused upon that core message of needing to stay at home to reduce the transmission of this disease, and to save lives.\u201d\nA plan did exist, he insisted: \u201cWork is taking place across different parts of Whitehall in readiness for the point where we are able to relax the social distancing measures which we have in place.\u201d\nRaab set out five conditions that would need to be met before any change in policy: allow the NHS to cope;

Testing was then restricted to those who were admitted to hospital, and contact tracing was stopped. The numbers of cases and deaths in the UK soared and a lockdown was imposed on 23 March.\nHancock said on Friday that the government would rebuild the teams of contact tracers as part of a renewed testing and tracing strategy.\nHis predecessor Jeremy Hunt, who is chair of the health select committee of MPs where Hancock was giving evidence, pointed out that South Korea had up to 1,000 contact tracers. \u201cPublic Health England had 290 people doing this at their peak, but they now say it has been wound down. Are we going to build it up again?\u201d he asked.\nHancock said yes and that contact tracing teams would be part of a strategy that included the use of a phone app to identify recent contacts and warn them that they might need to self-isolate.\n\u201cThat brings together teams from NHSX, who are leading on the app, with a huge array of partners that are working within that, [and] from Public Health England, who are the experts on what we refer to as external contact tracing,\u201d he told the committee.\n\u201cThe app is itself a contact tracing app, that is the point of it, to be able to assist individuals to do contact tracing themselves by notifying people who they have been in close contact with when they have downloaded the app. And then of course link that to testing, so people can get the tests.\u201d\nTesting, tracing and isolating the contacts of people with Covid-19 is expected to be a key part of the exit strategy for every country that has imposed a lockdown, as a way to keep control of the epidemic. Asked if he accepted that comprehensive contact tracing would need to be in place to lift the UK lockdown, Hancock said the government was working \u201cincredibly hard\u201d on the WHO-recommended strategy.\n\u201cWe do need to have comprehensive test, track and trace in place as soon as possible,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we need to get the technology right, we need to have the people, and we\u2019re building that resource, and obviously we need to have the testing and we\u2019re ramping that up as well. So we do need to have all three of those in place and we\u2019re working incredibly hard to make sure that we are.\u201d\nEarlier, Costello said the nationwide lockdown could have been avoided, with only the capital facing severe restrictions.\nHe said the example of 10 identified cases in 300,000-400,000 people in Yorkshire meant that in such areas people could have continued to go about their lives and work while maintaining physical distancing.\nHancock admitted the government had discussed it. \u201cWe did consider having a London-specific lockdown and decided it was better to do it across the country as a whole.\u201d\nThis was because people would be travelling between London and other parts of the UK and, he said, it was striking how the country had come together to observe the restrictions. \u201cTo separate one part of the country from another has downsides in terms of the national unity we have seen in the response.\u201d\nJohnson\u2019s spokesman later declined to say anything beyond Hancock\u2019s words on the possible scale of testing needed to implement a full regime of contact tracing.\nHe also declined to comment on why the UK did not isolate or trace people arriving in the country from overseas, while adding that this policy could potentially change in the future: \u201cWe\u2019ve always said that we don\u2019t rule out taking steps if that\u2019s what the science advises.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again", "title": "UK to start coronavirus contact tracing again", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:51:16 GMT", "summary": "<p>Matt Hancock says government to rebuild teams amid criticism it stopped strategy too early</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Britain is to restart tracing the contacts of people who have had coronavirus symptoms, the health secretary has said, reverting to a policy recommended by the World Health Organization but abandoned by the UK as the numbers of cases and deaths began to rise in early March.</p><p>Matt Hancock told the health select committee on Friday that police, fire, prison and Department of Work and Pensions staff would now be eligible for coronavirus testing, amid growing concerns that the country will miss its target of 100,000 coronavirus tests a day by the end of April.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/uk-to-start-coronavirus-contact-tracing-again\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f076725d5c5fb6452ffc9185218e32b75b3ff0a1/178_146_3972_2383/master/3972.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=faa6879bb762c3c2d65e880e4abd2a8f"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/sturgeon-separate-scottish-lockdown-exit-plan-may-be-logical": {"story": " has said it would be \u201clogical and sensible\u201d for Scotland to diverge from the rest of the UK in terms of an exit strategy from lockdown where the evidence directs it.\nThe Scottish first minister issued what will be seen as a veiled criticism of the UK government\u2019s warning that discussing an exit strategy at this stage would confuse critical health guidance.

If we relax measures too much, then we will see a resurgence in transmission,\u201d he told the BBC\u2019s Today programme.\nMatt Hancock, the health secretary, reacted to the criticism testily, saying Ferguson \u201cadvises government. He is not in the government.\u201d\nWhen pressed for a timescale on lifting restrictions, Raab pointed to Boris Johnson\u2019s remark of a month ago, on 19 March, that it would take 12 weeks to \u201cturn the tide\u201d of the virus. \u201cThat, broadly, is the outline,\u201d Raab said. The UK is now in its fourth week of lockdown.\nRaab set out five conditions that would need to be met before any loosening of the rules. These included a sustained fall in the daily death rate, and confidence that the supply of PPE and testing can meet future demand.\nIn a rebuke to rightwing commentators arguing for the lockdown to be lifted to alleviate the economic costs of having businesses shuttered and workers furloughed, Raab added that \u201cearly relaxation would do more damage to the economy over a longer period\u201d.\nRather than lifting the restrictions, Raab talked of \u201cadjusting\u201d them, adding: \u201cIt could mean relaxing measures in some areas, while strengthening measures in some other areas\u201d. A Downing Street source called the approach \u201ckeyhole surgery\u201d.\nHe stressed that while the infection rate had fallen in the community, \u201cwe have issues with the virus spreading in some hospitals and care homes\u201d.\nHancock promised more testing and protective equipment for care home staff on Wednesday, with many reporting inadequate supplies and haphazard advice from the government.\nThe Labour leader, Keir Starmer, welcomed the extension of the measures. \u201cI fully support the government\u2019s decision to extend the lockdown,\u201d he said. \u202a\u201cThe priority now must be to ensure we see a ramp-up in testing, that staff get the PPE they desperately need, and that more is done to protect our care homes from the virus. We also need clarity about what plans are being put in place to lift the lockdown when the time is right.\u201d\nRaab was deputising for the prime minister, who is convalescing at Chequers after being hospitalised with the virus. Downing Street said Boris Johnson was not involved in the decision to extend the restrictions, but that Raab had updated him by phone.\nOne Tory MP said it was \u201crightwingers in cabinet and the wider party\u201d who were pushing for an early exit from the lockdown, but that No 10 was highly cautious.\nA senior Westminster source with knowledge of the government\u2019s thinking said they believed a move towards contact tracing conducted by an army of trained people was about to become \u201cthe next big U-turn\u201d. \nPrevious reversals of government policy include the acknowledgement of the need for mass testing, the abandonment of the herd immunity strategy, and the realisation that an antibody test was harder to develop than first thought.\nAnother change of heart could be over the wearing of masks by members of the public. Chief medical officer Chris Whitty said this was \u201ca very live issue that we are re-examining\u201d. He said there was medical evidence of a \u201csmall\u201d effect on the transmission of the virus.\nAdvisers had previously suggested there was little benefit to wearing masks, but Whitty said: \u201cThe point about scientific advice is, it evolves.\u201d\nThe chief scientific adviser, Patrick Vallance, also hinted at ongoing measures, saying the challenge was to get R \u2013 the transmission rate of the virus \u2013 below 1 and keep it there. \u201cThere may be a number of measures that need to be continued to allow that,\u201d he said. \u201cThere will be some changes that need to take place, around things like home-working.\u201d\nHancock will come under pressure to commit to a coordinated testing and contact tracing regime when he appears before a blockbuster select committee hearing on Friday, led by former health secretary Jeremy Hunt and attended by several other committee chairs as guests.\nHunt has long been pushing for a mass testing and tracing strategy, which was dismissed by the government\u2019s experts in mid-March when they moved from a policy of trying to contain the virus to trying to delay its peak.\nAt that point, on March 26, Dr Jenny Harries said testing and contact tracing was \u201cnot an appropriate mechanism as we go forward\u201d, despite the World \n Organization\u2019s exhortation to \u201ctest, test, test\u201d.\nThe government has since conceded the point on mass testing and begun to develop an app that can help trace contacts. However, there are concerns that online tracing will not be effective at reaching older people, that it is voluntary, and that privacy concerns may hamper its usefulness. \n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-lockdown-to-continue-for-at-least-three-weeks-raab-confirms", "title": "UK lockdown measures could last until June, Raab says", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 19:17:57 GMT", "summary": "<p>Government says measures must go on because it is not clear whether the virus has peaked</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Dominic Raab has warned the public that lockdown measures could last into June as ministers came under increasing pressure to set out a detailed plan to ease the stringent restrictions.</p><p>Setting out plans for a minimum three-week extension to prevent a deadly \u201csecond peak\u201d of infections, Boris Johnson\u2019s stand-in said that any relaxation now would \u201csubstantially increase the number of deaths\u201d.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/uk-lockdown-to-continue-for-at-least-three-weeks-raab-confirms\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c246d0ee67ade8407ce1ae672713a88abd6ac240/0_0_2560_1536/master/2560.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=7247c18ac4681e330a2cfd1926d70dca"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/government-extends-loan-guarantee-scheme-to-cover-bigger-firms": {"story": "The government has sought to allay growing fears about the impact of a protracted \nlockdown on the economy by announcing that its loan guarantee scheme will be open to mid-sized firms that were in danger of being left out.\nOn the day that the foreign secretary, Dominic Raab, confirmed that the quarantining period would last for at least a further three weeks, the Treasury said it was taking steps to help businesses with annual turnovers of more than \u00a345m \u2013 which are stuck in what has become known as the \u201csqueezed middle\u201d.\nThe chancellor, \n, said that all viable businesses with turnover of \u00a345m-\u00a3250m would be able to apply for government-backed loans of up to \u00a325m.

But no information about what \u2013 if any \u2013 data would be shared or timeframe was provided. BAME (black, Asian and minority ethnic) campaigners said it was imperative that figures were shared quickly so that analysis could begin as soon as possible.\nA Guardian analysis found that of 53 NHS staff known to have died in the pandemic so far, 68% were BAME. They include 22 nurses, two porters, a radiology support worker, a patient discharge planner and a hospital bus driver. While the proportion of people from a minority ethnic background is higher in the NHS \u2013 \n \u2013 the respective mortality rate, like the proportion of critical care admissions, is out of kilter.\nLord Woolley, director of Operation Black Vote, said: \u201cAnecdotally, we know that Covid-19 is having a devastating impact on BAME communities, particularly in England. We suspect that BAME individuals, including frontline and essential workers, are disproportionately exposed to this virus. If Public Health England has ethnic data on who\u2019s dying in hospital, they must release it. Only with transparency of data and quick action from all relevant agencies will we save lives.\u201d\nThe government\u2019s low-key announcement of an inquiry came after \n. He said: \u201cAt face value, it seems hard to see how this can be random.\u201d\nThe Guardian understands that Public Health England is collating and analysing data on the ethnicity of patients who have died of Covid-19 in healthcare settings. However, it is not clear how long it will take to gather and publish the data.\nDr Zubaida Haque, deputy director of the Runnymede Trust, said: \u201cIf you\u2019re not disaggregating by ethnicity, that means we have no idea whether there is any racial disproportionality at all. If you don\u2019t ask the questions in data, then you don\u2019t have answers. If you don\u2019t measure it, then that problem doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d\nAsian and black patients are over-represented in critical care and account for a third of patients in hospital, despite making up a quarter of the population in the same areas. A study of \n from the Intensive Care National Audit and Research Centre showed that BAME patients accounted for 33.6% of patients with the virus, despite accounting for just 14% of the population, according to the 2011 census.\nAsian patients make up 14.4% and black patients accounted for 11.9% of those in critical care units. However, when the figures are tallied against the local population, black patients are over-represented by a factor of two.\nThe BMA called for an inquiry based on the early critical care figures. More than \n. At least 23 people of Filipino origin are known to have died since the start of the outbreak.\nThe shadow equalities secretary, Marsha de Cordova, welcomed the review, but said it was \u201cnot yet clear whether it will be independent, when it will be concluded, and who will be leading it\u201d.\nRachel Logan, Amnesty UK\u2019s law and human rights programme director, said the government review was needed, but had to be transparent. \u201cThere\u2019s been much talk of how coronavirus is a \u2018great leveller\u2019, but these figures appear to show that some communities are suffering more than others,\u201d she said. \u201cIt is essential that the government ensure it is properly investigating why.\u201d \nResponding to the inquiry, Nagpaul said: \u201cWe are pleased that the government has heeded the BMA\u2019s call for this review. However, if the review is to have any meaningful impact, it needs to be informed with real-time data to understand why and how this deadly virus can have such a tragic disproportionate toll on our BAME communities and healthcare workers. This must include daily updates on ethnicity, circumstance and all protected characteristics of all patients in hospital as well as levels of illness in the community, which is not currently recorded.\n\u201cIt also means taking vital steps now to protect our BAME communities until we can develop a detailed understanding of the threats they face. This could include that those at greatest risk, including older and retired doctors, are not working in potentially infectious settings.\u201d\nYasmin Qureshi, MP for Bolton South-East, has also called on the government to release data about BAME deaths. Along with a group of 27 Labour MPs, she urged Matt Hancock, the health secretary, to examine why such a large number of BAME doctors were dying. \u201cWhen I became aware of these statistics I asked the Department of Health to explain,\u201d she said. \nEthnicity is not collected on death certificates in England and Wales, unlike in Scotland where it was added in 2012. This means that based on current mortality data it will not be possible to assess who has died from the virus outside hospitals.\nA spokesperson for the Office for National Statistics said work was underway to match data on Covid-19 deaths to other data sets to understand more about how ethnicity and deprivation are related to who is dying. However developing the new data is expected to take weeks, by which time it is anticipated the peak of the first wave of the virus will have passed.\nThe chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the intention of the inquiry was \u201cto look at this in some detail and then what we really want is, if we see any signal at all, we want to then know what next we can do about it to minimise risk\u201d.\nPHE medical director, Yvonne Doyle, said: \u201cThere is emerging evidence to suggest that Covid-19 may be having a disproportionate impact on ethnic minority groups. There is limited recording of ethnicity across almost all data sets so we must be very careful in making any assumptions. This is a really important issue and detailed and careful work needs to be done before we draw any conclusions.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/data-on-bame-deaths-from-covid-19-must-be-published-politicians-warn", "title": "Failure to publish data on BAME deaths could put more lives at risk, MPs warn", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 19:09:56 GMT", "summary": "<p>Government agrees to inquiry into why patients from ethnic minorities seem worse affected by Covid-19 <br></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/why-know-how-many-bame-people-dying-coronavirus-data\">Q&amp;A \u2013 Why don\u2019t we know how many BAME people are dying?</a> </li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li></ul><p>Public Health England must publish the data it holds on the deaths of BAME patients from Covid-19 as failure to do so could be putting lives at risk, politicians and pressure groups have warned.</p><p>With patients from ethnic minority backgrounds over-represented in critical care units and among NHS staff who have died, the government on Thursday agreed to an inquiry into why they appear to be more affected by the virus.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/data-on-bame-deaths-from-covid-19-must-be-published-politicians-warn\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3bd637dea509057759740f9164314c191d1fd82/0_233_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=6e0c28b74dd02b85a696d36af4c6e25f"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/the-guardian-view-on-recognising-care-work-a-royal-charter-would-help": {"story": "uring the past week, the health secretary, \n, has been the butt of much-deserved criticism over the mishandling of the coronavirus crisis in care homes.

On news programmes and at daily briefings, politicians across the world face versions of the same query again and again: \n? But that\u2019s the wrong question.\nImagine a family has escaped a rampaging bear in the woods, seeking refuge in a log cabin. After sheltering there for days and weeks, they\u2019re desperate to know when they can come out. But they wouldn\u2019t simply be asking \u201cWhen?\u201d They would be asking \u201cWhen will it be \n?\u201d which is a different and tougher question, one whose answer would depend on several other questions: has the bear been tamed? If it hasn\u2019t, do we have the weapons to destroy it or at least protect ourselves against it? And are those protections strong enough that we won\u2019t have to rush back inside the cabin the moment we\u2019ve ventured out?\nWe should be clear on one thing. Impatience to see an end to this mass, global quarantine is understandable. It\u2019s not just boredom or lack of stamina that prompts it. There are people struggling to put \n; there are people whose \n is faltering; there are people for whom a day stuck at home is a day stuck with a \n. For them lockdown is a jail sentence and they need it to end. \nSo of course it makes sense to long for an exit strategy. But it has to begin with an understanding of what lockdown is and what it is not. It\u2019s tempting to see it as a solution: everyone stays at home, we \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and then, slowly and gradually, we lift the restrictions and return to normal. But that\u2019s not how it is. Instead, lockdown is merely the crudest, bluntest instrument we could reach for when the coronavirus first struck. Its primary objective was to keep the number of people infected sufficiently low that the health service could cope. Judged by that standard, preventing, say, the NHS in Britain being overwhelmed, it has succeeded.\nBut essential though it was and is, lockdown could only ever be a first step. It enjoys remarkable support \u2013 still backed by 91% of Britons, according to a \n \u2013 but it was always going to be dropped the moment a better option became available. The ideal would be a vaccine, equivalent to removing the bear\u2019s claws and teeth, but that, we are warned, is 18 months away at best. So what\u2019s the other route out of hiding?\nRead the \n, and they all come back to one thing. Sure, social distancing will have to endure, in one form or other, but the key will be the one identified by the World Health Organization at the start: testing, testing, testing.\nAnd yet here, too, there is a misconception, and it is one of scale. So far, testing has been limited to those with symptoms and in hospital. But the Nobel laureate \n \u2013 admittedly his prize was for economics rather than epidemiology \u2013 has got a lot of attention for a plan that argues that for the economy, and human life, to return to anything like normality, testing will need to be conducted for millions of people, all the time. He imagines health workers being tested at the start of a shift; the same would go for care workers, pharmacists, police officers and bus drivers. You might add teachers and restaurant workers. Romer wouldn\u2019t bother testing people who already have symptoms: they should be presumed positive and immediately self-isolate. It\u2019s the \u201casymptomatic spreaders\u201d you need to identify, stopping them in their tracks. The logic underpinning the plan is clear: there will be no point in reopening shops, pubs and restaurants if people feel too scared to visit them. As virologist Prof Nicolas Locker puts it, \nDo the maths and the numbers are colossal: Romer estimates some 22m tests would be necessary every day in the US alone, the equivalent of testing every American once every two weeks. Consider that there\u2019s still no sign that Matt Hancock will reach his goal of 100,000 tests a day in the UK, and you realise how many orders of magnitude stand between where we are now and where we would need to be. \nThe obstacles are huge and obvious, though Romer reckons he has answers for all of them. Shortage of swabs? Move to \n. Shortage of the key chemicals known as \u201creagents\u201d? The test kits that rely on them are not the only option. The sheer numbers of tests that would have to be produced? The world\u2019s manufacturers could do it; \n. Which, given that our lives depend on it, should be there.\nIf that seems daunting, there is another approach. It would still require testing \u2013 though not on the same scale \u2013 followed by contact tracing: finding all those who\u2019d been in close proximity to someone who\u2019d tested positive and isolating them. \u201cTest, trace, isolate\u201d also has logic on its side, but it, too, takes lots of money and people. It\u2019s thought \n.\nThat means using the hiatus of lockdown to recruit and train people now in the mechanics of contact tracing. With no leadership from the top \u2013 on Thursday Donald Trump effectively \n that the buck stops with the 50 states \u2013 the likes of Massachusetts are already assembling their own squads of contact-tracers. \n is doing the same, deploying a combination of librarians and medical students. The UK government could follow their lead immediately, putting to work some of the thousands of people currently at home and itching to help. Tech can play a role, too: note this week\u2019s announcement that Apple and Google will join forces to see if they can produce the app that will make tracing easier and faster, though the threat to privacy of such \n is obvious.\nWhat specific methods are deployed matter less than the bigger shift that is required, which is one of imagination. Governments need to realise that what\u2019s coming is not a decision about easing this or that rule of social distancing, but rather a massive political, industrial and collective drive unseen since the last war. It may well mean repurposing factories to mass-produce testing kits.

It will, however, take more than a badge if he doesn\u2019t hit his 100,000 tests a day target for the end of April, having already \n target for the middle of the month.\nCan you recall if the 100,000 tests was ever technically a pillar? It all feels beyond living memory. If you told me he had announced them sometime in the mid-Cretaceous period, staring soulfully into the camera even as a T-Rex pursued him, I\u2019d believe you. In fact, it was a fortnight ago.\nStill, don\u2019t take the above as an unfavourable review of the specific energy Hancock brings to the daily Downing Street press conferences. I personally respect the way he treats each one like the James Blunt \n, delivering his painful truths right down the barrel. Just leaves it all on the stage. If you honestly can\u2019t hear another word of one of these things, I\u2019d recommend watching them with the sound down and Blunt whacked up to 11 \u2013 the pandemic equivalent of getting your test match footage from Sky but the commentary off the radio.\nNaturally, this type of artiste always divides the critics. Even so it was very disappointing recently to learn that one No 10 official had told the Sunday Times\u2019s \n: \u201cThere is not much love for Matt Handjob here.\u201d Known to receive even less favourable notices from his officials is Raab, who gives the 5pm press conference with the air of a man who strongly suspects there\u2019s a chalk penis drawn on his back, but is just going to butch it out by facing forward till the bell goes.\nTalking of butching it out, the good news is that the government is \n the Brexit transition period beyond the end of this year, even if the EU requests a delay, and against the \n. I know the ultra-Brexiteers enjoy a good war metaphor, so let\u2019s just say that this out-of-the-pandemic-into-the-no-deal move threatens to give our nation a strong \nfeel to it. By way of background, the Indianapolis was torpedoed and sunk by the Japanese in 1945, in the worst naval attack of the second world war. Those sailors who survived were left bobbing in the Pacific, where, over the next few days, they were subject to the \n in history.\nAnyway, thus things rumble on while the prime minister remains off games. Boris Johnson is at Chequers, where his spokesman clarifies he is \u201cnot doing government work\u201d. A slightly strange styling, which makes some people assume Johnson is finishing his late-delivered Shakespeare book. I\u2019m sure nothing is further from the truth \u2013 not even Johnson himself, who has rarely been in the same hemisphere as the truth for his entire career.\nBut there is clearly some trade-off as to how his stand-ins should handle this particular chit from matron. On the one hand, they keep stressing absolutely everything is proceeding in accordance with a plan laid out by the prime minister before he fell ill. On the other, they want to avoid going too far on that front, or risk casting the UK as the driverless car of governance, a largely automated enterprise where the role of prime minister is essentially meaningless. A bit like that of regimental goat, or England football captain. (The Italians, of course, just give the armband to the oldest guy on the pitch. Then again, the past couple of months have arguably shown that we don\u2019t care to learn anything much from the Italians.) \nPerhaps the best thing that can be said at the moment is that at least we\u2019re not the United States. At the time of the Antonine plague, the Roman empire was ruled by Marcus Aurelius, a philosopher-statesman whose Meditations \n a full 1,840 years after his death. At the time of the coronavirus, the US is ruled by Donald Trump, a realtor whose \n \u2026 probably won\u2019t do. Pressed repeatedly on Thursday to tell his supporters who are flouting the lockdown to stay at home, Trump said: \u201cThey seem to be protesters that like me and respect my opinion.\u201d So, unfortunately, he couldn\u2019t bring himself to.\nHaving actively contributed to the loss of lives, Trump is going to have to get very creative in citing any that he\u2019s saved. That said, last month was the \n a school shooting since 2002, so maybe he could credit himself with the new approach to the US school shootings problem currently being trialled. Which is to say: no schools. All that time parent activists have spent trying to limit guns, it turned out that the smart way to do it was just to shut schools. Really makes you think.

This is a world where carers are going to work without protective equipment, the government has only just announced widespread \n, and care home deaths in England are \n in the official count.\nSome of the hardest-to-hear stories of this pandemic are emerging from the care sector. There\u2019s been so much coverage of the awful decisions that doctors may have to face in rationing scarce intensive care beds. But over in social care, managers and staff have been grappling with impossible moral dilemmas for weeks with scant guidance. How do you prevent coronavirus spreading to those whom it\u2019s most likely to kill when you are sending staff without protective equipment from home to home to assist more than a dozen people a day with intimate tasks such as washing and eating? Do you allow relatives into a care home \n to their loved one or is the risk to other residents too great? What do you tell those at the local hospital who want to discharge patients into your care who haven\u2019t been tested, potentially jeopardising the lives of the people who already live there?\nIt is a welcome development to see the care sector thrust into the spotlight for once, dominating the recent Downing Street press conferences. Here\u2019s hoping that it leads to decades-old calls for social care to be properly funded and \n finally getting some traction. But rather than pretending this is just a case of an urgently needed policy fix unaccountably languishing at the bottom of to-do lists, we need to confront that it is a symptom of something deeply wrong with the way we think about ageing.\nThis pandemic is lifting the carpet on some hard societal truths long swept out of sight. One of the most brilliant scientific advances of the last century has been the stretching of human lifespans; one of the least edifying aspects of collective human behaviour has been our failure to adapt to its downside: people contending with longer spells of physical and mental decline in the last years of their lives.\nJust because you have dementia does not mean you cannot feel joy and love; just because you need help to wash and dress does not make you incapable of richly stimulating conversation. But the way we talk about, think about and organise older care has become utterly dominated by the management of decline. As soon as someone needs help to live, the expectation of what it means for them to live a good life drops dramatically. We adopt a primitive baseline against which to judge whether we are meeting our societal obligation to our elders, and then we fail even at that: an estimated \n are doing without the help they need with everyday tasks such as washing and dressing.\nI don\u2019t want to grow old in a world where it\u2019s considered to be enough if I\u2019m free from physical harm in my last few years. But this cultural more will be stubborn to shift because it is a function of the pervasive ageism that runs through society. Like all prejudice, ageism is inculcated \n. But what distinguishes ageism from other prejudices is that what we seem to recoil at, what we ultimately are all fearful of, is what we will all one day \u2013 if we\u2019re lucky \u2013 become.\nIts consequences are ruinous: partly because there is growing evidence that as we take our own ageism with us into older age, it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy; researchers believe older people who themselves buy into negative \n about ageing are more likely to suffer ill health, for example. But also because that fear and prejudice runs through every aspect of how we care for older people. Caring is mischaracterised as low-skilled work \u2013 a misnomer, as anyone who has ever observed a carer at work will know \u2013 partly because it is feminised labour. But also because it is so often conceived of as a series of physical tasks rather than the emotionally tough but potentially incredibly rewarding job it is.\nThe psychoanalyst Isabel Menzies Lyth observed in the 1950s that hospitals organised nursing the sick and dying as a series of fragmented physical tasks, the same task repetitively performed for many patients, each patient cared for by several different nurses, in order to protect the nurses from the emotional stress of death and loss. In other words, patients were objectified and dehumanised to conform with what was thought to be a tolerable psychological strain for carers. Too much of this ill-conceived approach lingers in how we conceive of care 70 years later. In a world where pitifully paid care workers are expected to zip in and out of homes in short slots that force them to choose between washing and feeding, it is a miracle that they have not evolved into an army of emotionally dead robots in the interests of self-preservation.\nThat\u2019s the tragedy of the badge. It gently hints at a cultural revolution we so desperately need: to see care work as enabling people to live a life filled with joy and love, and to compensate and value that work accordingly. But the badge is so completely and utterly unequal to that task. That\u2019s not really Matt Hancock\u2019s fault. It\u2019s on each and every one of us.\n Sonia Sodha is chief leader writer at the Observer and a columnist for the Guardian and the Observer\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/carers-badges-ageism-britain", "title": "Coronavirus has revealed what's wrong with our approach to ageing | Sonia Sodha", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 12:40:23 GMT", "summary": "<p>Britain\u2019s attitude to older people focuses on managing decline rather than enabling joy and love</p><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li><p>\u201cHave a <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/16/care-workers-owed-badge-applause-pay-rights-coronavirus\">badge</a>.\u201d The latest initiative of the health secretary, Matt Hancock, to boost the status of care workers has been widely mocked, not because it\u2019s an innately bad idea \u2013 care workers report being turned away from shopping slots reserved for health and emergency staff \u2013 but because it seems like such an utterly incidental gesture.

If worried about lockdown, they shouldn\u2019t be. The poor dears should resume their works. Rome might burn, but Nero did not want his Colosseum to run late.\nCountless megaprojects \u2013 in housing, distribution, retail and construction generally \u2013 would dearly love such reassurance. This is not only because, alone in Europe, the British government refuses to give details of how it intends to end lockdown, so that businesses might at least plan. There is worry also over the wider impact of the Office for Budget Responsibility\u2019s warning of an astonishing \n drop in the economy, certain to afflict all public spending, capital and current.\nEven the most insensitive politician could tell you that a new high-speed train from Birmingham to London, not due for over a decade, is hardly a priority. Every other service and project must pass through the valley of the shadow of death. Why on earth not HS2? In such circumstances, some sense of priorities should surely prevail. Hence the frantic desire of \n, its suppliers and lobbyists to maintain momentum and put their project beyond all further doubt.\nIn an effort to explain his decision, Stephenson grasped at the nearest cliche and declared he \u201ccannot delay work on our long-term plan to level up the country\u201d. But London to Birmingham covers the most prosperous counties in Britain. It is nothing to do with levelling anywhere, and certainly not the north. If he meant it, he should build an urgently needed railway from Yorkshire to Lancashire, or boost Manchester\u2019s dire commuter services. Or if this is about vital infrastructure, why is Stephenson ignoring London\u2019s Crossrail? It is surely more crucial for London\u2019s recovery.\nStephenson\u2019s decision is nothing to do with levelling. It has to do with the \n continue to exert over ministers, even in time of crisis. HS2 has been feasting on billions of government pounds, now possibly at risk. \nThere was a time when Johnson would have favoured Crossrail as London\u2019s mayor. When he arrived at Downing Street, he clearly sought a new love. As his eye roamed the Treasury harem it lighted on a more voluptuous project, HS2. Poor Crossrail.\nSince Johnson\u2019s February decision allowing the first stage of HS2 to proceed, it has become ever clearer that this railway is unlikely to go any further than Birmingham. It duplicates four other pathways to the north, all of which can offer any needed capacity by less exorbitant means. The chief beneficiaries from the extra capacity will be London commuters from the home counties and south Midlands. Even so, Wednesday\u2019s announcement let slip that the project\u2019s business case had plummeted from \u00a32.70 for each pound spent to between \u00a31.20 and 70p, well below any normal Treasury threshold. We can only assume chancellor Rishi Shunak has treated it like another aircraft carrier or power station, and shoved it in a drawer marked \u201cvanity\u201d.\nThe coronavirus saga is speaking volumes on how British government operates, crisis or no crisis. Politics is dominant. It is now known that ministers were warned in \n in 2016 that it was seriously ill-prepared for a pandemic. It did nothing. It did virtually nothing last January when Covid-19 broke out in China and began to spread. The only conceivable reason for this inertia is that antigen tests, ventilators and intensive care beds are politically boring. They can be left to underfunded locals to handle.\nWhitehall\u2019s instinct is always to look to big solutions, with big institutions and big corporations to deliver them. Since the Covid-19 crisis began, I never until this week heard the word local at any press conference. It was all big NHS, big pharma and big science, never local health care suppliers, let alone care homes. A month of \u201cprotect the NHS\u201d has given us grand \u2013 and reportedly half empty \u2013 Nightingale hospitals, while council-run care homes, responsible for the most vulnerable people, are frantic and under-resourced.\nThe reason is simple. \n, they are local and have seen disproportionate cuts under austerity. For the past month, they were not even included in the daily death toll \u2013 as if their deaths were unreal. Germany and Scandinavia, which respect local government, have been far better prepared and have benefited accordingly. It is plain that in Britain there has been a massive malfunction between the centre and locality, which any inquiry will have to address.\nTrains may not be that important just now. But the HS2 decision illustrates a common syndrome. It is a glamorous state project, favoured even as local rail services languish. To Johnson and his colleagues, small means nothing. The sum on the table for this week\u2019s go-ahead for HS2 was \u00a335bn. I am sure Keynes would approve of injecting large sums into a recession-hit economy.

On a day-by-day basis I can just about muddle through the coronavirus pandemic. I still wake up \n and it can still take a couple of hours for me to feel brave enough to get out of bed, but for the rest of the day I can more or less function. Work provides both a distraction and an outlet for my feelings of powerlessness, pedalling up and down the same hill 10 times on my wife\u2019s (much too small) bicycle replaces cortisol with endorphins and our small back garden has been a haven in the good weather. So I am more than aware that I am so much more fortunate than many others in the current situation. It\u2019s when I start to think about the future that things rather fall apart. When will I next see my daughter in Minneapolis? We were due to fly over in August but, even if the flights are operational, would it be a good idea to go to the US with health insurance that is certain to exclude Covid-19? When will I next see my son in Brighton? When will I next see my mother? Her care home went into lockdown three weeks ago and has now reported its first suspected coronavirus case. So, she is lonely and frightened, confined to her room, seeing almost no one. These are the thoughts that dominate my subconscious and to which there are no clear answers. Which is presumably why I wake up in a complete state every morning.\nI can\u2019t help feeling that government ministers must be secretly wishing they had never agreed to give a daily Downing Street press conference. Obviously, given the gravity of the situation, they didn\u2019t have much choice in the matter but, having now watched every single one of them, it\u2019s now clear their main underlying purpose is to show just how little command of the situation ministers actually have and how policy is being made up day by day. Rishi Sunak has already delivered at least six new budgets since his first one on 11 March and looks set to hit double figures by the end of the month. Matt Hancock has managed to forget his first promise to deliver 25,000 daily tests by the middle of April \u2013 we\u2019re currently at about 16,000 \u2013 and has instead committed to \n by the end of the month. He has also rather belatedly remembered he is secretary of state for social care as well as health, though care workers would probably more appreciate personal protective equipment and testing than his offer of \n. And Sunak and Hancock are two of the more able cabinet ministers. After many complaints that the government was treating the coronavirus as man\u2019s work, the home secretary, Priti Patel, was sent out last Saturday to face the media. An experiment unlikely to be repeated. First Patel managed to imply that NHS workers were deliberately wasting PPE and then insisted that the government had so far carried out \n. Which by my reckoning means that every person must have already been tested 4,615 times each. Her performance was so poor it almost made me wish that I worked on a Saturday.\nOne of the main problems with the daily press conference is that ministers have to pretend that they have some important news to divulge even when they almost invariably don\u2019t. In the absence of Boris they don\u2019t even dare to suggest what criteria might govern their thinking in any relaxation of the lockdown, which gives each briefing a sense of deja vu. One of the most annoying parts of every ministerial statement is the constant reiteration of the mantra that \u201cthe government\u2019s actions have at all times been driven by the science\u201d. Mostly because that merely serves to underline just how little the government actually understands the nature of science. The whole point of science \u2013 especially in regard to a disease as new as the coronavirus \u2013 is that there is no overall consensus. Disagreement and pressure-testing each other\u2019s arguments are precisely what makes scientists and other academics tick. So there is no uniformity and the government is having to make judgment calls on which scientists are the most trustworthy. Donald Trump is clearly doing that, having \n for having less of a grip on the science than a couple of his close mates. And yes, the UK government has been too craven to call the Donald out on this. Nor does the UK\u2019s insistence on scientific evidence quite explain why the government did a complete U-turn nearly four weeks ago. On the Friday, it had been fine for 80,000 people \n; by the following Monday the country was being put in near total lockdown. I don\u2019t remember anyone saying the science had changed over the weekend.\nMy concentration levels are still hopeless. I have done slightly better this week, having now made it to page 10 of Hilary Mantel\u2019s The Mirror and the Light and I can report the extra six pages are every bit as good as the first four that I had already read several times. It\u2019s immensely frustrating as there\u2019s nothing more I would like than to be immersed in someone else\u2019s world, but my mind won\u2019t allow me to settle. I\u2019m reluctant to temporarily give up as I hate the idea of abandoning a book I have waited the best part of eight years to read, but I fear this is the way I\u2019m heading. After all, it\u2019s not as if I\u2019m not spoiled for choice as I have Hadley Freeman\u2019s House of Glass, Adam Macqueen\u2019s Beneath the Streets and Svenja O\u2019Donnell\u2019s Inge\u2019s War piled up beside my bed. I did also have Maggie O\u2019Farrell\u2019s Hamnet but my wife has already pinched that and has advised me not to read it at present. It\u2019s set against the background of plague and she is worried about the effect it might have on my mental health. I\u2019ve also been struggling to dip in and out of \n because, although the pieces are an ideal length, the print is just too small. My eyesight is fighting a losing battle with the almanack and I fear that next year I may have to order the large print edition. In the meantime, I have come up with a reasonable compromise by downloading it as an audible book. It calls itself the Shorter Wisden \u2013 mainly because it doesn\u2019t give you the scores of every game \u2013 but still comes in at over 20 hours. And at \u00a310, I reckon 50p an hour is a bargain.\nApparently it\u2019s Friday, though it\u2019s hard to be too certain as the days all tend to merge into one another with little to differentiate them. Same feelings, same activities, much the same TV. Weirdly it\u2019s the weekends I now find trickiest as they have even less structure than the weekdays. I have to struggle more to find a sense of purpose and retain my fragments of identity. But when this lockdown started I made a commitment to try to end every week on a positive note, so here are my notes of love among the ruins. I would rather I didn\u2019t have to look at myself during online calls \u2013 do I really look that bad? \u2013 but FaceTime and Zoom chats both with family and friends have proved to be a lifeline. Although they are reminders of the closeness that has been lost, they do give me a sense of connection. And I\u2019ve been genuinely touched by the number of readers who have emailed in to check up on me, to share their own thoughts and send me photos; I\u2019m also happy to report that \n has now adjusted to the new normal. Initially he was rather put out to find that Jill and I were around 24/7 and he would self-isolate in our daughter\u2019s bedroom. But now he seems to need less \u201cme time\u201d and has come back to sleep in our room. I have finally finished cataloguing my book collection and am about to start on the ceramics: a far trickier enterprise as it involves including pictures and my tech skills are rudimentary at best. I will report back. Incidentally, I have taken to talking to my pots ... I fear I may be turning into Prince Charles. Also huge kudos to the Spurs\u2019 players and the supporters trust who persuaded the club to reverse its decision to furlough and lay off non-playing staff. It made me feel proud to be a fan again. And finally, do watch \n on iPlayer. It\u2019s an astonishingly moving and intimate collection of homemade movies collected into a feature length film. I cried. But then I tend to do that a lot these days.\n Same as it ever was\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/17/herbert-hound-has-adjusted-new-normal-wish-i-could-say-same-digested-week", "title": "The dog has adjusted to the new normal \u2013 wish I could say the same | John Crace", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 10:38:03 GMT", "summary": "<p>Another week of doom, gloom and government incompetence.

A \n?\nWhen the lockdown is finally lifted, the world we will finally emerge into looks dark. The Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) has warned of a staggering \n this spring. Businesses are collapsing all around us, and according to the OBR\u2019s forecast, unemployment may reach an unthinkable 10%.\nThe most obvious victims of the virus are older people, dying in multitudes in hospitals, \n and in their own homes. Often they die alone, gasping for air and many, it\u2019s feared, without sedation and morphine. Heartrending stories of nurses, doctors and others \n are the ones that grab our attention, but they are distant outliers on the graphs. The overwhelming number of deaths are among older people. \n, 87% of those who have died from coronavirus are over 65. \nThe lockdown is primarily in place to protect the vulnerable \u2013 mainly the old but other frail people, too. It\u2019s also there to protect the NHS from a surge that would have sunk it: the government was far slower than other European countries in its response, and as a result \n. But, however reluctant at first, it became politically and morally impossible for the government to imagine a pile-up of some 500,000 coffins, the \n of Imperial College epidemiologists. Sweden, refusing a shutdown, is now seeing its \n above that of its locked-in neighbours. Will that be socially or politically sustainable?\nThe blighted lives of the young are also a tragedy. This year\u2019s students, who are already heavily indebted, are emerging into a deep recession. \n and 68% of firms are cancelling work experience. Before, in the austerity years, graduates often had to work in service jobs \u2013 baristas, waiting staff, caterers, call-centre operators. Will these jobs still exist to fall back on this time around? No one knows if or how far the hospitality, \n, arts and events sectors will recover. And if graduates are knocked back, those without degrees will be hit even harder.\nStand back and look at the context. My lucky \n is the one being protected at the cost of everything else. Born into a brand new NHS, gifted free university education and jobs in a hugely expanding white-collar sector, we benefited from fine pensions and the mighty windfall of outrageously inflating property values for homes bought originally for a modest price.\n born in the 1950s now owns a second home or buy-to-let property. No one intended to do down younger generations, but those in their 30s are already worse off than their parents were at their age, and less likely to own a home \u2013 ever. No home, no pension, university debt, no savings; no one designed this great betrayal, but no one stopped it happening either. Meanwhile, my generation overwhelmingly voted in Conservatives who rewarded them with a \n rising above stagnant wages year after year: the old now are least likely to be poor.\nThat\u2019s why, when this is all over, a huge redress is due to the young. A \n this week argued that the burden of paying the enormous cost of the crisis should not fall on those of working age alone: \u00a320bn could be saved over five years by abandoning the pension triple lock. In the FT yesterday, Labour\u2019s shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, called for \n with a more progressive tax system. Surely that will have to mean more justice between generations, and between earned and unearned income. Any social care reforms to raise standards must be paid for from the property assets of older people themselves.\nBecause we live and love in families, this generational divide seems emotionally abstract, with no conflict between grandparents and grandchildren. The young have admirably supported a lock-in to defend the old. They have not protested at how their patrimony will be stolen by the pensioners. Nor have they complained enough at how \n and the Conservatives on to them by sheer weight of numbers. The young are very nice, too nice for their own good, perhaps.

On the basis of the country\u2019s behaviour these past three weeks, there is good reason to expect the measures to be observed.\nThe extension puts fresh pressure on the public, the vulnerable, business and the economy. But it is the correct decision. The coronavirus pandemic remains virulent. Thursday brought \n of 4,618 new positive tests for the virus and of 861 new deaths in hospital in the UK. These figures are worse than \n. The trend of new cases and deaths is abating by comparison with a week ago, which is cause for some relief. But the numbers are still high. The fight against the pandemic, as Mr Raab said, is at a \u201cdelicate and dangerous\u201d stage. This is not the time to start easing the control measures in ways that could endanger lives and threaten to overwhelm the health and care services.\nMr Raab was aware that things are beginning to change in some countries. But he gave few clues away about UK government thinking on future easing. That was no surprise either. Ministers still regard public discussion of any exit strategy as off limits. \n gave a vigorous defence of that policy in a round of interviews on Thursday, insisting that the government has no intention of deviating from the core message to stay at home and save lives. His junior minister \n even said journalists should stop asking about the subject.\nBut the pressure on ministers to start setting out their future options will not go away. Nor should it. Ministerial silence means one of two things. It either means that ministers cannot agree what to do next, especially without a lead from Mr Johnson. Or it means they do not trust the public to behave responsibly. Both are alarming. The first implies that parts of the government may have a \n recklessness towards public safety. The second implies that ministers underestimate the people. Both of them justify \n attempts to bring the exit strategy issue out into the public realm where it should now belong.\nThere is no contradiction between maintaining lockdown and airing some practical issues to which the country will need to become accustomed when the lockdown is eased. The public can keep two ideas in their heads at the same time. Most people understand that social distancing remains key to suppressing the pandemic until immunity is established and vaccines can be developed. Even more would do so if British ministers possessed the kind of communication skills about the dilemmas that \n displayed this week. Refusing to discuss the easing of controls may in the end have the opposite effect to what is intended, by creating a pent-up wish to abandon the current disciplines.\nMr Raab skated on thin ice over this. But the return of parliament next week will make the government\u2019s position harder to maintain. So will the prudent easing measures that are being introduced in some \n this week. It is therefore time to lay the ground for an eventual easing here too. It needs to be done well and rationally, not badly and confusedly, let alone in the Trump manner.\nWe need to start getting used to the idea that parts of the economy, some demographic groups and maybe some regions will begin, perhaps in late May, to be subject to different levels of control. Some businesses, workforces, \n and locations will nevertheless remain in lockdown, possibly for months. Continued social distancing, wider public use of protective equipment including masks and gloves, and some system of testing and \n will all need to be considered. Good policing of the easing will be crucial. The new normal will not be like the old, pre-pandemic, normal in many ways. The government may need to call a halt if virus cases spike upwards.

The next day I travelled to Northumberland to see my parents, who are in their 60s, and asked them to take the advice very seriously. We washed our hands so much that weekend we ended up with cracked skin.\nMy reporting on the coronavirus stretches back quite far. Because I happened to be passing through Victoria in London one day at the end of January, I was sent to the Department of Health\u2019s press conference. There, the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, told us two people from the same family were being treated for the virus at the infectious disease unit at Newcastle\u2019s Royal Infirmary. It took a newspaper\u2019s general reporters just a matter of hours to find out the pair were holidaymakers from China staying at a hotel in York. For weeks, we watched what was happening in China and our questions to Downing Street were about how to get people back from Wuhan and the quarantine facility set up in Wirral, interspersed with the usual topics such as Brexit, HS2 and floods.\nBy early March, it was clear cases were rising, and we were invited to helpful technical briefings with Whitty and the chief scientific adviser, Sir Patrick Vallance, held in No 9 Downing Street, and on one occasion upstairs in No 10, in the beautiful Pillared Room, which we usually only see once a year at the prime minister\u2019s Christmas reception for journalists. We got the government\u2019s Covid-19 strategy an hour before one of the press conferences to familiarise ourselves with it. It was there we saw the shocking estimate that up to a fifth of the workforce could be off sick. Trump-style, Johnson took questions from nearly every reporter in the room \u2013 staying far longer than usual. The day hadn\u2019t all been smooth, though. At one point we were herded out of No 9\u2019s lobby meeting room to get ready for the press conference and left filing copy crouched on the paving slabs of the country\u2019s most famous street. A reporter from the Financial Times, Laura Hughes, and I talked about how filing from roadsides felt like general election territory.\nJournalists continued to traipse into Downing Street for the daily televised press conferences in person until the weekend of 21-22 March, every day feeling more anxious in the office, sharing stories of relatives\u2019 and friends\u2019 health. The last one I attended personally was on Thursday 19 March, when, in a nod to social distancing, the chairs were arranged in a staggered way. This should have happened days earlier. I was sitting near Sky\u2019s Beth Rigby, ITV\u2019s Robert Peston and the Guido Fawkes reporter Tom Harwood. It was one of Johnson\u2019s more bizarre performances, where he asked us all if it was useful to keep doing the question and answer sessions, and joked about wearying us with them. We had a brief chat surrounding the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman and press secretary afterwards, known as a \u201chuddle\u201d, where we were told journalists would be key workers. We all knew we were standing too close and broke it up after a few minutes.\nThe next day we all began working from home and set about creating weird and wonderful office spaces. Mine is in a room stuffed to the rafters with my landlady\u2019s belongings. I only have to do a 180-degree spin on my chair to be able to retrieve alpine walking poles, an artist\u2019s easel and some MiracleGro. None of us really said goodbye to each other in Westminster, but in hindsight it might have been wise to acknowledge the fact that we were decamping from our perilously tatty offices in Westminster for an unknown amount of time. We\u2019re social beings and thrive off each other.\nLike the rest of the country, we\u2019re doing Zoom calls and Google Hangouts, and it\u2019s tough. Not seeing colleagues is a huge miss. While WhatsApping MPs is fine, there\u2019s nothing quite like bumping into them or seeing who is in conversation with who in the Portcullis House coffee shop. I\u2019ve done Radio 4\u2019s Westminster Hour over FaceTime and the BBC\u2019s The Papers over Skype, all without any trouble, except accidentally capturing my shared house\u2019s drinks collection in the background.\nDowning Street has been accommodating by turning our daily meetings into a daily teleconference, expertly chaired by the Daily Mail\u2019s political editor, Jason Groves. We usually get to ask our own questions when we\u2019re all sitting in No 9, but it\u2019s easier for the flow of the call if Jason groups them together and asks the prime minister\u2019s official spokesman. More than 100 people are listening in, and like the rest of the country we\u2019re struggling with the mute button!\nThe press conferences are welcome, but not ideal in a virtual format. We\u2019re on a rota system for questions and mine was this Sunday gone, which saw me propping up my phone on boxes and books to get the right angle. The ministers take your questions but the format means you cannot follow up, which means they are getting away with an awful lot of waffle and non-answers. And this hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed by the public, or our readers. If we could get a right of reply to our questions I think it would be more worthwhile for everyone.\nWe have many more weeks to go of this entirely new lobby reporting structure. Everyone has adapted, but the real challenge will be when politicians are added back into the mix after recess. That\u2019s when the government\u2019s digital communications will be tested again, because if one thing is certain, it\u2019s not just the journalists hungry to scrutinise the executive. The MPs I\u2019ve spoken to cannot wait to get stuck in. They\u2019ve seen our daily Q&A with ministers, and they want their own.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/membership/2020/apr/04/coronavirus-westminster-politics-briefing-johnson", "title": "'The moment everything changed': Covering Covid-19 from Westminster", "published": "Sat, 04 Apr 2020 11:00:02 GMT", "summary": "<p>Our political correspondent on the bombshell briefing that changed the mood across the country</p><p>I was in the midst of the usual reporter\u2019s juggle, trying to write on a notepad balanced on one thigh while resting a dictation machine on the other, when the prime minister\u2019s tone suddenly changed, prompting me to look up.

They have to get on and process this stuff because livelihoods are at stake.\u201d\nBailey said one way of speeding up the process would be for the government to underwrite 100% of the loans, which are interest-free for 12 months, but insisted this was a matter for the chancellor, \n, to decide.\n\u201cThe chancellor needs to make that decision because the public purse is at risk,\u201d Bailey said.\nVery small firms made up a high proportion of the loan applications and the question was whether the system would be unblocked if the Treasury took all the risk. UK Finance, the bank industry lobby group, said this week that 21% of the 28,460 formal CBILS applications had so far been approved. However, more than 300,000 firms have reportedly made informal inquiries \n, which is part of the government\u2019s wider business support package worth \u00a3330bn.\nFigures from the US suggest that American banks have been much quicker than those in the UK to provide loans to small companies to help them through the lockdown. Bailey said he was not acquainted with the US system, but said: \u201cThis is an issue that has to be tackled.\u201d\nThe Bank is currently working on its forecasts for the economy ahead of the publication of its next quarterly monetary policy report in early May \u2013 the first since the spread of Covid-19 to the UK closed down large parts of the economy.\nBailey said that on the basis of the evidence from credit card use, business surveys, the housing market and claims for universal credit the OBR\u2019s projections of a 35% slump did not seem excessive. \u201cThere is nothing implausible about a number of that size,\u201d he said.\nThe governor was cautious, however, about the OBR\u2019s assumption that activity would return to its pre-Covid-19 levels by the end of the year. Bailey said that would depend on the level of business failures and whether the government\u2019s furlough scheme led to much higher unemployment.\nThe International Monetary Fund said earlier this week that global financial stability could be put at risk by the deepest recession since the 1930s, but Bailey said the UK\u2019s financial system was robust enough to withstand the pressure. The Bank\u2019s stress tests had not factored in Sunak\u2019s decision to support the economy through higher public spending, wage subsidies and loan guarantees.\nBailey said the government was having no trouble raising the money from the financial markets to cover its sharply increased borrowing, adding that Sunak had yet to draw on a \n at the Bank of England, which was announced last week.\nBut he made clear that the Bank was keeping a close eye on the long-term implications of the additional debt being accumulated by the government, businesses and households. \u201cWe have to watch that very carefully,\u201d Bailey said.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/bank-of-england-tells-lenders-to-get-on-with-covid-19-business-loans", "title": "Bank of England tells lenders to \u2018get on with\u2019 Covid-19 business loans", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 15:06:51 GMT", "summary": "<p>Governor Andrew Bailey says \u2018livelihoods are at stake\u2019 as figures show only \u00a31.1bn lent to small firms</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The Bank of England governor, Andrew Bailey, has told Britain\u2019s high street lenders that they must \u201cput their backs into\u201d providing loans for companies affected by <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Covid-19</a> amid evidence that many will fail without urgent help.</p><p>Bailey said commercial banks were under no illusion that \u201cthey had to get on with this\u201d to prevent long-term scarring of the economy as a result of the pandemic.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/bank-of-england-tells-lenders-to-get-on-with-covid-19-business-loans\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/385178f2e5c6a15ee244fb5e4fb192dcf47709af/15_151_5107_3064/master/5107.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3fd66c2a677e08814fca353d1a184a9c"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-vauxhall-plans-socially-distanced-car-production-in-uk": {"story": " has unveiled a socially distanced manufacturing plan that it hopes will provide the blueprint for companies to make a safe return to work during the coronavirus lockdown.\nSigns of new physical distancing measures are evident throughout the Vauxhall plant in Ellesmere Port, Wirral.

Work areas and toilets will be cleaned every hour.\nFace masks and eye protection will be compulsory at all times. The company has also mined YouTube videos for ideas, such as visors made by cutting a slot in clear plastic.

This means manufacturers in England can continue to operate, as long as they follow our clear guidance to protect employees who cannot work from home and ensure work is done safely in the workplace.\u201d\nHowever, carmakers have privately expressed concerns that the lack of explicit industry-specific guidance has made some firms fearful of a backlash if they restart.\nMatthias Holweg, a professor of operations management at the University of Oxford\u2019s Sa\u00efd Business School, said reducing the rate of output was a key part of enforcing social distancing, as it would allow workers to be spaced further apart on the production line.\nCarmakers hired consultants as early as January to help secure vital parts as factories started to close, and logistics networks are working at full stretch. The UK car industry\u2019s lobby group on Friday said it was working with European counterparts and governments on how to \u201csafely and successfully restart what is one of the country\u2019s most valuable economic assets\u201d.\nYet perhaps the biggest problem remains the certainty of recession. Companies will \nthey do manage to produce.\nHolweg said he expects carmakers to build up about three months\u2019 worth of stock, as they did during the financial crisis just over a decade ago \u2013 but \u201cit\u2019s an imperfect solution,\u201d he said.

Our client\u2019s character and actions have now been completely vindicated by the court.\n\u201cBy contrast it is EY which has been found to have committed serious professional misconduct at the highest echelons of the organisation. This important judgment sends a clear message to would-be whistleblowers that they do not have to tolerate unethical conduct within their organisation, no matter how high up the chain it goes.\nIn his judgment, Kerr said: \u201cGold is used in the banking industry, for investment purposes; in the jewellery industry; and in the electronics industry, for manufacturing. It is recognised internationally as being among the \u2018conflict minerals\u2019 attractive to criminals and terrorists because it is relatively easy to move and holds its value well.\n\u201cFor these reasons, the importance of good due diligence and regulation in the gold refining industry and other \u2018conflict minerals\u2019 trading is emphasised in guidance published by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and in US legislation known as the Dodd-Frank Act. The claimant and his colleagues at EY Dubai and EY MENA saw this as an opportunity to acquire fruitful work producing assurance reporting to gold refiners in Dubai and elsewhere in the region. Kaloti was the most substantial of the Dubai refiners, with the largest market share.\u201d\nCommenting on the Morocco transactions, Kerr said: \u201cI accept as a fact that the defendants were responsible for suggesting to Kaloti that it should draft its compliance report in a manner that masked the reality of the Morocco gold issue, removing the reference to Morocco and changing the coating of gold bars with silver to documentary irregularities. I regard this as professional misconduct.\u201d\nAn EY spokesperson said: \u201cWe are surprised and disappointed by the judge\u2019s decision, its introduction of an unprecedented legal duty and its financial award to a former EY Dubai partner. We will appeal and, therefore, not comment in detail. It was the work of an EY Dubai assurance team that uncovered serious irregularities and reported them to the proper authorities. Their work ultimately resulted in sanctions against the refiner and contributed to significant changes in the sourcing of precious metals and the regulation of refiners in Dubai.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/ey-ordered-pay-whistleblower-11m-dubai-gold-audit-case", "title": "EY ordered to pay whistleblower $11m in Dubai gold audit case", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 16:48:35 GMT", "summary": "<p>Court rules accountancy firm breached code of ethics in its dealings with a refiner</p><p>A former partner at the accounting firm EY has been awarded $10.8m (\u00a38.6m) in damages after being forced out of his job when he exposed professional misconduct during an audit of a Dubai gold refiner.</p><p>The high court in London ruled on Friday that EY had repeatedly breached the code of ethics for professional accountants in its dealings with one of its clients, Kaloti Jewellery International.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/17/ey-ordered-pay-whistleblower-11m-dubai-gold-audit-case\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f47e0c1fe593617e18d14a33d0b1a319e8e6aad7/0_157_3500_2100/master/3500.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=f67bc36ad684f26409e6dfe89bfbe164"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/the-guardian-view-on-the-future-of-farming-lets-think-about-food": {"story": "ne of the many effects of the coronavirus in the UK has been to dramatically raise awareness of our food system \u2013 that is, the set of arrangements that determines how we shop and eat.

Leaked no-deal planning documents revealed warnings that fresh food supplies could be reduced, causing price rises (although details in the public domain are limited, the government \n). The regulations that will govern agricultural imports in any future trade deal with the US are highly contentious, with the opening up of a big European market to the US food industry \u2013 which has low standards compared with the EU \u2013 among America\u2019s chief aims.\nBritish consumers, as well as farmers who fear being undercut, are widely understood to be unenthusiastic about the prospect of \n \u2013 and the American mega-farms that it symbolises. Antibiotics, steroid hormones and pesticides are all used more freely by farmers in the US. But in the UK, too, the number of industrial-sized pig and chicken farms (classified as holding more than 2,000 pigs or 40,000 birds) has recently gone up \u2013 by \n. Around 70% of all UK farm animals are farmed intensively in indoor units.\nThis is because meat and dairy products produced in this way are cheap. At a time of widening inequality, with \n (along with the poor nutrition evidenced by obesity) among its most unjust manifestations, it is difficult to argue against the importance of affordability. But while anti-poverty measures must be among ministers\u2019 top priorities, both now and when the crisis eases, some means must also be found to balance the downward pressure on prices, with a more rounded assessment of what food is worth.\nAnimal welfare considerations are one reason to do this. The risk of disease outbreaks in intensive farms is another. While the precise origins of Covid-19 remain uncertain, warnings about the risk of other outbreaks (avian flu, for example) must now be taken seriously. In rich western countries like the UK, there are also health reasons for most people to rebalance their diets away from animal products and towards plants (as the UK\u2019s school and hospital caterers recognised this week with a pledge to \n). Broader environmental considerations of land use and biodiversity, food security and resilience must also be part of the equation. British agriculture is skewed towards livestock and grain feed.\nChange will not be easy. Our food system is complicated, as is the global one of which it is part. Competing priorities \u2013 including price, animal welfare, carbon footprint and consumer preference \u2013 produce inevitable conflicts. But some beneficial effects could follow from our having been forced to take more notice.

Even as a temporary solution to make sure this year\u2019s harvest doesn\u2019t go unpicked, this is unlikely to work, because contrary to what many might think, this is not an \u201cunskilled\u201d job. And looking beyond this very strange year, this is going to be a problem that only becomes more severe from 2021, when post-Brexit immigration rules come into force.\nThere have been a lot of people inquiring about doing this work in recent months, with large job sites reporting increased interest in fruit-picking jobs, farm labouring, and so on, and no doubt some of the 70,000 seasonal workers we need will come from this. The majority of this interest goes no further thanthe inquiry stage, though, and there are many reasons for this.\nTo point out the obvious, it\u2019s an incredibly physical job. Having worked as a fruit-picker for years, I can tell you that it\u2019s certainly not (as some television ads imply) wandering calmly through a field or orchard, casually selecting an apple or a cauliflower. You have to work quickly, carrying heavy bags of apples, or bent over picking strawberries, and, other than lunchtime, without the luxury of the familiar coffee break or chat in the kitchen with a colleague.\nEvery person has a quota, and in many places you\u2019re only paid by how much work you get done. There\u2019s a minimum wage, true, but if you don\u2019t hit the targets repeatedly you\u2019re likely to lose your job, and to meet those targets you have to work at full speed, all day. Even as a 19-year-old, by the time it got to Thursday afternoon the thought of having to do it all again the next day was difficult. The idea that these jobs could be filled by people who\u2019ve spent most of their lives working in offices is not realistic, and many would be asked to leave fairly quickly.\nThere\u2019s also a lot to think about while you\u2019re harvesting fruit, it\u2019s not as simple as walking along and collecting everything in your path. When picking apples, you need to consider the size, the colour, whether they\u2019re damaged, how firm they are (different for each variety) \u2013 and making sure that you don\u2019t accidentally pick the pollinator tree with a different variety on it, thereby ruining the entire box of fruit. Pick poor-quality fruit, and it won\u2019t count towards your pay.\nThe issue isn\u2019t just money, though. These jobs simply wouldn\u2019t work for many people. They\u2019re located in specific regions, generally far from major towns and transport links. For those who don\u2019t drive or live in those areas, that means finding accommodation. Some farms provide this for seasonal workers, but it would need serious adaptation for social-distancing rules, and not everyone would be happy with the conditions. It\u2019s also not free, so people already paying rent or a mortgage on their home would be paying twice.\nWork starts early in the morning, which equally won\u2019t suit many. This is not about British workers being lazy, as some commentators are fond of implying. If you have to take your children to school for 8:30am, then a job that starts at 7am isn\u2019t practical. The seasonal nature of the work would also be a problem for many people. \nFor these reasons, and many others, we are always going to need seasonal workers in this country, many of them from abroad. They should be welcomed, and valued, as specialised key workers without whom we would be paying far more for our fresh produce. The path we are on with our immigration system risks not only making it impossible for these workers to fill these jobs, but also a resurgence of problems the industry has seen in the past. No one wants to see the return of \n \u2013 and the employment and human rights abuses many seasonal workers suffered at their hands. \nWhat we\u2019re seeing this year should serve as both a wake-up call that our post-Brexit immigration system will need to be changed and an opportunity to change the way we view those who fill these key jobs, in agriculture and many other industries. If you can, \u201cpick for Britain\u201d \u2013 but please value those who come here from abroad to do this too.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/laid-off-pick-fruit-seasonal-workers-special-skills", "title": "Anyone who's been laid off can pick fruit, right?

On news programmes and at daily briefings, politicians across the world face versions of the same query again and again: \n? But that\u2019s the wrong question.\nImagine a family has escaped a rampaging bear in the woods, seeking refuge in a log cabin. After sheltering there for days and weeks, they\u2019re desperate to know when they can come out. But they wouldn\u2019t simply be asking \u201cWhen?\u201d They would be asking \u201cWhen will it be \n?\u201d which is a different and tougher question, one whose answer would depend on several other questions: has the bear been tamed? If it hasn\u2019t, do we have the weapons to destroy it or at least protect ourselves against it? And are those protections strong enough that we won\u2019t have to rush back inside the cabin the moment we\u2019ve ventured out?\nWe should be clear on one thing. Impatience to see an end to this mass, global quarantine is understandable. It\u2019s not just boredom or lack of stamina that prompts it. There are people struggling to put \n; there are people whose \n is faltering; there are people for whom a day stuck at home is a day stuck with a \n. For them lockdown is a jail sentence and they need it to end. \nSo of course it makes sense to long for an exit strategy. But it has to begin with an understanding of what lockdown is and what it is not. It\u2019s tempting to see it as a solution: everyone stays at home, we \u201cflatten the curve\u201d and then, slowly and gradually, we lift the restrictions and return to normal. But that\u2019s not how it is. Instead, lockdown is merely the crudest, bluntest instrument we could reach for when the coronavirus first struck. Its primary objective was to keep the number of people infected sufficiently low that the health service could cope. Judged by that standard, preventing, say, the NHS in Britain being overwhelmed, it has succeeded.\nBut essential though it was and is, lockdown could only ever be a first step. It enjoys remarkable support \u2013 still backed by 91% of Britons, according to a \n \u2013 but it was always going to be dropped the moment a better option became available. The ideal would be a vaccine, equivalent to removing the bear\u2019s claws and teeth, but that, we are warned, is 18 months away at best. So what\u2019s the other route out of hiding?\nRead the \n, and they all come back to one thing. Sure, social distancing will have to endure, in one form or other, but the key will be the one identified by the World Health Organization at the start: testing, testing, testing.\nAnd yet here, too, there is a misconception, and it is one of scale. So far, testing has been limited to those with symptoms and in hospital. But the Nobel laureate \n \u2013 admittedly his prize was for economics rather than epidemiology \u2013 has got a lot of attention for a plan that argues that for the economy, and human life, to return to anything like normality, testing will need to be conducted for millions of people, all the time. He imagines health workers being tested at the start of a shift; the same would go for care workers, pharmacists, police officers and bus drivers. You might add teachers and restaurant workers. Romer wouldn\u2019t bother testing people who already have symptoms: they should be presumed positive and immediately self-isolate. It\u2019s the \u201casymptomatic spreaders\u201d you need to identify, stopping them in their tracks. The logic underpinning the plan is clear: there will be no point in reopening shops, pubs and restaurants if people feel too scared to visit them. As virologist Prof Nicolas Locker puts it, \nDo the maths and the numbers are colossal: Romer estimates some 22m tests would be necessary every day in the US alone, the equivalent of testing every American once every two weeks. Consider that there\u2019s still no sign that Matt Hancock will reach his goal of 100,000 tests a day in the UK, and you realise how many orders of magnitude stand between where we are now and where we would need to be. \nThe obstacles are huge and obvious, though Romer reckons he has answers for all of them. Shortage of swabs? Move to \n. Shortage of the key chemicals known as \u201creagents\u201d? The test kits that rely on them are not the only option. The sheer numbers of tests that would have to be produced? The world\u2019s manufacturers could do it; \n. Which, given that our lives depend on it, should be there.\nIf that seems daunting, there is another approach. It would still require testing \u2013 though not on the same scale \u2013 followed by contact tracing: finding all those who\u2019d been in close proximity to someone who\u2019d tested positive and isolating them. \u201cTest, trace, isolate\u201d also has logic on its side, but it, too, takes lots of money and people. It\u2019s thought \n.\nThat means using the hiatus of lockdown to recruit and train people now in the mechanics of contact tracing. With no leadership from the top \u2013 on Thursday Donald Trump effectively \n that the buck stops with the 50 states \u2013 the likes of Massachusetts are already assembling their own squads of contact-tracers. \n is doing the same, deploying a combination of librarians and medical students. The UK government could follow their lead immediately, putting to work some of the thousands of people currently at home and itching to help. Tech can play a role, too: note this week\u2019s announcement that Apple and Google will join forces to see if they can produce the app that will make tracing easier and faster, though the threat to privacy of such \n is obvious.\nWhat specific methods are deployed matter less than the bigger shift that is required, which is one of imagination. Governments need to realise that what\u2019s coming is not a decision about easing this or that rule of social distancing, but rather a massive political, industrial and collective drive unseen since the last war. It may well mean repurposing factories to mass-produce testing kits. At the very least, it should mean a dedicated cabinet minister for testing.\nThis demands a huge shift by the UK government, which wasn\u2019t even \ncoming out of hospital and going into social care until this week. But nothing less will be enough. It\u2019s not enough to flatten the curve; we have to get ahead of it. It\u2019s true that we cannot stay in lockdown for ever. But we cannot leave until it\u2019s safe \u2013 and that requires a monumental effort, starting right now.\n Jonathan Freedland is a Guardian columnist\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/political-imagination-end-lockdown-mass-testing-contact-tracing", "title": "Only a monumental effort of political imagination can end lockdown | Jonathan Freedland", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 15:42:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>The methods \u2013 whether it\u2019s mass testing or contact-tracing \u2013 matter less than the huge shift in thinking that is required</p><p>Sometimes you\u2019re just asking the wrong question.

Indignant deficit scolds would have asked how one planned to pay for it, and complained about burdening our grandchildren with debt and bankrupting our country. Bernie Sanders bent over backwards to explain how he was going to pay for a Green New Deal or Medicare for All. These programs don\u2019t seem as expensive any more. Suddenly the government is planning \u201chelicopter drops\u201d of cash. Larry Kudlow, who \n the Obama stimulus during the global financial crisis, is touting the current stimulus as \u201c\nMain Street assistance program in the history of the United States\u201d.\nNobody is seriously asking how we are going to pay for this stimulus \u2013 and they shouldn\u2019t. It took a global pandemic to explode the myth that federal government spending has to be \u201cpaid for\u201d.\nThe Covid-19 crisis has clearly demonstrated what should have been obvious already: provisioning society \u2013 whether with food, disinfecting wipes, toilet paper or medical supplies \u2013 is not a financial issue. If we can\u2019t produce enough masks, ventilators or food, finance will not help. Society\u2019s capacity to produce real output is what limits its ability to provision itself. And this is precisely what the virus threatens, as workers stay home, supply chains break down and businesses shut their doors.\nOn the financial side, a sovereign government can always afford to buy what is for sale in its currency, as Modern Money Theorists have long explained. \n because it simply credits bank accounts when it spends. This is \n a prescription, but merely a description of what actually happens. \n. This happens through the thick and thin of the business cycle, crisis or not. If the US government wants to buy more ventilators or masks, finance cannot be an impediment.\nBut what happens when ventilators and masks are not available for sale even as companies are operating 24/7? More money may not solve the problem, but the government still has a role to play. During the second world war, the US quickly became \u201cthe arsenal of democracy\u201d by repurposing its productive capacity to meet the needs of the war. Through diligent planning \n We were able to cut \n down from 365 days to 92, 62, and, finally, to one day\u201d. We can mobilize our resources once again to build temporary hospitals, and to ensure a sufficient supply of medical equipment and whatever else is necessary to overcome the crisis.\nBuying into the deficit myth, for generations we have been living below our means \u2013 paralyzed by the belief that finance is the constraint. Prolonged periods of slack and jobless recoveries have disincentivized investment and hurt our productive capacity and labor productivity. \n our economy leaves millions unemployed or underemployed and a significant amount of our capacity idle (before the epidemic, our factories were only operating at three-quarters of capacity). We have underinvested in public healthcare, education and infrastructure and imposed extreme limitations on social assistance programs. As of this writing, \n to go through with its plan to kick 700,000 Americans off the food stamps program to save a measly $4.2bn over five years. We have been living in \u201cpoverty in the midst of plenty\u201d, as John Maynard Keynes aptly noted in the Great Depression.\nOnce this crisis passes, the deficit scolds will be back at it again, trying to put roadblocks in front of progressive policies. We will be told we can\u2019t afford Medicare for All, Jobs for All, College for All or halting climate change. The centrists will try to get us back to \u201cnormal\u201d \u2013 ie an economy that leaves so many behind.\nIt is imperative that we resist. What progressives need to push for is creating a different kind of economy through a Green New Deal. To do so, we need to distinguish between the myths and real constraints, understanding \n is financially possible\u201d for a sovereign government. \n is about real resources and technology, not about finance.\nThe original New Deal was also dogged by concerns about excessive government spending. The second world war eliminated that obstacle, unleashing extraordinary economic mobilization and decades of prosperity. Hopefully the coronavirus crisis will not be as destructive as the Great Depression, but if there is one thing it should destroy, it\u2019s the myth of the deficit.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/coronavirus-deficit-american-economy", "title": "Coronavirus has destroyed the myth of the deficit | Yeva Nersisyan and L Randall Wray", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 12:31:10 GMT", "summary": "<p>No, federal government spending doesn\u2019t have to be \u2018paid for\u2019.

estimated \u00a310bn fortune, is donating \u00a312.5m to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic after being \u201chumbled\u201d by the dedication of \n workers.\nThe NHS \n Together fund said it was \u201cincredibly grateful for this most generous donation\u201d, but some politicians and inequality campaigners pointed out that the gift equates to just 0.1% of the Duke\u2019s centuries-old inherited wealth.\nHugh Grosvenor, 29, the seventh Duke of Westminster and the world\u2019s richest person under 30, said on Wednesday he wanted to \u201csay a huge thank you to all our amazing NHS staff and everyone providing critical frontline services\u201d.\n\u201cWe are all humbled and incredibly grateful that you are working tirelessly to keep us safe and keep the country functioning,\u201d said Grosvenor, who is a close friend of the royal family and godfather to Prince George. \u201cAs they keep us safe, I want to help provide as much support to them and their families as we can.\u201d\nPoliticians and campaigners, however, suggested that perhaps Grosvenor \u2013 who\n on the bulk of the family fortune after his father Gerald Grosvenor\u2019s death in 2016, as it had been transferred to trusts \u2013 could dig a bit deeper into the family coffers.\n: \u201cThe trusts, being onshore, pay income tax, capital gains tax and \u2013 via the 10 yearly charge \u2013 inheritance tax.\u201d The spokesman also said \n were \u201cspeculative\u201d, and the last official valuation in December 2018 put net assets at \u00a35bn.\nClive Lewis, the Labour MP for Norwich South, said \u201call philanthropic endeavours are good and to be welcomed\u201d, but added that the multimillion-pound gift \u201cwon\u2019t even leave a dent\u201d in Grosvenor\u2019s fortune.\n\u201cThere is an acute awareness at this time of crisis that there are a record number of billionaires in the world, and their wealth has been rapidly increasing,\u201d Lewis told the Guardian.\n\u201cMy message is to thank them for any gift but also to tell them that there will be many people \u2013 myself included \u2013 who will be asking: \u2018Is it right that people who are putting their lives on the line to fight this virus are some of the lowest paid in our society?\u2019 And at the other end, there are people who can give away [millions] and it won\u2019t even leave a dent in their fortunes.\u201d\nLewis said gifts from Grosvenor and \n have \u201ccome from a good place but they have thrown into stark contrast the gross inequalities in society\u201d.\nThe Facebook founder, Mark Zuckerberg, has committed $30m to Covid-19 research from his $67bn fortune, while China\u2019s richest man, Jack Ma, has pledged $14m to support vaccine research from his $44bn wealth.\nThe Duke, whose Grosvenor Estates company owns hundreds of acres of prime real estate in Mayfair and Belgravia in central London, said he was donating \u00a35m to NHS Charities Together to create a \u2018family fund\u2019 that would support NHS workers and their families.\nA further \u00a33m will go towards national medical research and development linked to Covid-19, and \u00a32m will be given to charities and organisations helping support people suffering from the economic and societal impact of the pandemic.\nThe \u00a310m donation announced on Wednesday comes on top of \u00a32.5m given in March to charities helping vulnerable families struggling to feed children who would normally receive free school meals.\nWanda Wyporska, the executive director of the Equality Trust, said: \u201cWhile any donation to the NHS at this time is to be welcomed, the billionaire duke could have made a transformative donation rather than scrabbling about down the back of a few of his sofas for some loose change.\u201d\nLuke Hildyard, the executive director of the High Pay Centre, a thinktank on excessive remuneration, said: \u201cThis is undoubtedly a well-intended gesture, so it feels churlish to note that it represents a pittance of the Duke\u2019s total inherited wealth or the annual rents he collects from his vast array of inherited property.\u201d\nGrosvenor is the UK\u2019s second-richest person, after the Ineos chemicals magnate Sir Jim Ratcliffe with \u00a312bn. A spokesman for Ratcliffe, who aims to produce 4m bottles of hand sanitiser a month free for the NHS and hospitals in Europe, said the billionaire had also made a \u201csubstantial\u201d personal donation to the fight against Covid-19.\nThe duke inherited the family fortune despite being the third of four siblings, as he was the only son.

Sykes has aroused particular ire with two populous Facebook groups dedicated to its behaviour.\nThe agent\u2019s argument is that customers\u2019 contracts are with the individual property owner, rendering it helpless. Initially, it told me that holidaymakers whose reservations had been cancelled could merely amend their booking at the same property to a later date, and it would waive its amendment fee as \u201cgoodwill\u201d.\nThen it decided to allow those unable to do this to request a refund, but a \u201crefund\u201d in Sykes\u2019 lexicon has a singular definition. If the owners agreed to pay out, Sykes would pocket the money and issue a credit note to the customer valid on any property for up to two years.\nIn RS\u2019s case, the owner did agree to repay the money via Sykes, but Sykes merely offered RS a credit note. The firm has finally agreed to refund payments for rentals up to 30 April, minus its service fee which it will hold as a credit note against future bookings. Provided owners cooperate. \u201cThings are ever-changing and Sykes is constantly working with its owners and customers to adjust and evolve as we all learn more,\u201d it says.\nRS has now received his funds, minus a 25% service charge worth \u00a3435 which Sykes is withholding as a credit against a future booking. This, too, is a goodwill gesture, it says, since it says the fee is for services already rendered.\nAs for AJ, it told me the owner has now decided to continue listing the property so more dates are available, and if the new booking proves more expensive it will \u201csee what it can do to help\u201d.\nHospital consultant \n turned to the \n when a holiday rental booked for his 40th birthday this month was cancelled.\n\u201cCottages.com has offered a credit note not a refund,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI will now be working in the hospital on my birthday, on call for 48 hours over the Easter bank holiday and on 12-hour night shifts after that,\u201d he said. Cottages.com declined to answer whether it was requesting refunds from owners when customers couldn\u2019t reschedule.\n\u201cWe are doing everything we can to help customers rebook their breaks, including offering price-matched breaks for the same or equivalent date in 2021,\u201d it says. However, RS was quietly refunded after I highlighted his key-worker status.\nAman Johal, director of consumer law firm, Your Lawyer, advises holidaymakers to check the terms and conditions of their contract. \u201cIt seems that some agencies may be trying to create loopholes which contravene consumer rights,\u201d he says. \u201cHowever, it is the responsibility of the contracting party to resolve it so it might be the holiday cottage owner who needs to sort it.\u201d\nUnfortunately, UK holiday rentals are not protected by the Package Travel Regulations which entitle customers to refunds if their holiday is cancelled and, deep within the small print of Sykes and Cottages.com, is a clause excluding the agents and owners of liability if a contract is frustrated because of events beyond their control.

The industry has pulled out all the stops in recent weeks to give an unprecedented number of customers a payment holiday, and we stand ready to help more over the coming months.\u201d\nThe government, the Financial Conduct Authority and lenders have all made clear that taking a payment holiday will not affect an individual\u2019s credit rating, and that remains the case.\nThe UK\u2019s credit reference agencies such as Equifax and Experian hold the data that makes up someone\u2019s credit score, but these bodies do not decide whether someone can obtain credit \u2013 that is up to individual lenders, who are ultimately free to decide who they wish to lend to.\nA payment holiday may make a borrower less desirable in their eyes, and that means that in some cases, people\u2019s future borrowing could be impacted. Mortgage broker Private Finance said: \u201cIf you require new finance in the next six months \u2013 in terms of a remortgage with a new lender, or going back to your existing lender regarding a new purchase - a repayment holiday will make your application less likely to be accepted.\u201d\nChris Sykes, a consultant at the firm, added that, by requesting a payment holiday, \u201cessentially you are announcing to your lender \u2013 and, potentially, other lenders who might see your bank statements in the future \u2013 that you are in financial difficulty. One lender has even told us that if a borrower has requested a payment holiday on an existing loan, any new cases will automatically be declined. Be warned that they won\u2019t be alone.\u201d\nOther official relief efforts have been slower to take off. The government recently admitted that just 1.4% of businesses asking about the \u00a3330bn \n (CBILS) via UK banks had so far been successful.\nafter Sunak launched CBILS to help small and medium-sized businesses with loans and other financing of up to \u00a35m apiece, it emerged that just 4,200 of the estimated 300,000 firms which had sought financial help ended up receiving rescue loans.\nPaul Dales, the chief UK economist at the consultancy Capital Economics, said it was essential that the government got the money to businesses to avoid a worst-case economic downturn. \u201cIt does feel like businesses hold the key, and if the government and banks can keep businesses afloat then they have fighting chance. If not, then the costs of this crisis will linger for longer.\u201d\nDales said the number of mortgage holiday approvals roughly reflected the one in 10 people whom he forecast would be unemployed due to the coronavirus outbreak over the coming months.\nWhile many workers would be renters rather than homeowners, so not covered by the mortgage holiday data, Dales said: \u201cIt is better than nothing and might mean that actually the housing market remains a symptom of the crisis rather than a cause. But if businesses can\u2019t get help in the short term, businesses will disappear, more households will be made unemployed, and then households can\u2019t spend as much anyway.\u201d\nMark Harris, chief executive of mortgage broker SPF Private Clients, said lenders should be applauded for enacting government policy within a relatively short period of time, adding that for many of those with income or employment issues, a payment holiday could be invaluable.\nBut he added: \u201cBorrowers should remember this is not \u2018free\u2019 money. During the payment holiday, interest is added to the mortgage and will be owed afterwards.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/14/lenders-in-uk-grant-12m-mortgage-deferments", "title": "UK lenders to grant 1.2m mortgage deferments", "published": "Tue, 14 Apr 2020 13:44:08 GMT", "summary": "<p>One in nine households get payment holiday but concern grows for their future credit rating</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>British lenders have granted mortgage repayment holidays to more than 1.2m borrowers as part of relief measures for households affected by the Covid-19 outbreak.</p><p>It means that about one in nine households will have their mortgage payments and interest deferred for up to three months to help <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/mar/17/uk-banks-set-out-details-of-covid-19-mortgage-holidays\">cope with loss of income</a> during the crisis.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/14/lenders-in-uk-grant-12m-mortgage-deferments\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/60b6e52fb96d39b1ad7541ece0a58ed34cec9723/0_320_5100_3059/master/5100.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=182286eaf81483c1ad53c5d4fe610518"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/money/2020/apr/14/stuck-abroad-o2-blocked-mobile-phones-fco-coronavirus": {"story": ", \nWe initially thought that a bar must have been put on your accounts as you had breached your roaming credit allowances, or similar.

He has previously led Ebola drug trials in west Africa and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC).\nThe Recovery team expects to be the first to have definitive data. \u201cWe\u2019re guessing some time in June we may get the results,\u201d said Prof Horby. \u201cIf it is really clear that there are benefits, an answer will be available quicker.\u201d But he warned that in the case of Covid-19, there would be no \u201cmagic bullet\u201d.\nThe team is working against a backdrop of doctors globally using drugs that they believe could be a cure citing \u201ccompassionate use\u201d, without yet having good scientific evidence. Politicians are also wading in. Donald Trump has backed hydroxychloroquine, a less toxic form of the old anti-malaria drug chloroquine.\nUsed together with azithromycin, an antibiotic, it could be \u201cone of the biggest game-changers in the history of medicine\u201d, Trump \n. The French doctor Didier Raoult has claimed the combination is a cure, leading to public clamour for the drugs in France. President Macron visited Raoult\u2019s hospital in Marseille last week, \n \nBoth hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin are being tested separately as part of the Recovery trial, and if there is any effect in patients given those drugs alone, compared with those given no drugs, they can be combined later.\nFor now, said Horby, the data flying around in emails from enthusiasts and posted on social media about patients who have recovered after taking hydroxychloroquine proves nothing. He says there is no real evidence to support its use yet.\n\u201cI would say no,\u201d said Horby. \u201cThere is in-vitro evidence that it is inhibitory against the virus [in the lab]. But I haven\u2019t seen any sound clinical data.\n\u201cWe\u2019re seeing a large number of publications. It\u2019s hard to keep up with them. Most of them are very disappointing. There was a paper that said it was a breakthrough \u2013 chloroquine works. But there was zero data in it. It seems to follow in that vein. They show a certain percentage of patients recovering, which would happen anyway.\u201d\nThe hype and pressure cause problems for serious researchers. \u201cThere is pushback from clinicians saying we should just use this because it clearly works and shouldn\u2019t use that because it clearly doesn\u2019t work. They are both wrong because neither of them know.\u201d\nThe number of patients being enrolled on the Recovery trial across the UK tells a story of doctors who have faith in scientific evidence over hope alone. Ten per cent of Covid-19 patients in the UK are now taking part in the trial, and the researchers say the more people join, the sooner they will have answers.\nAlso in the trial now are a combination of two antiretroviral drugs used in HIV treatment, lopinavir-ritonavir, known by the brand name Kaletra, and low-dose dexamethasone, a type of steroid used in a range of conditions, typically to reduce inflammation.\nThe next one to be included, said Horby, is an interleukin 6 antagonist, one of the immunomodulator drugs used in rheumatoid arthritis and to treat cytokine storm \u2013 something that happens when the immune system goes into overdrive, as can happen in Covid-19. They are looking at tocilizumab.\nThey are also in discussions about introducing convalescent plasma \u2013 blood from people who have recovered that contains antibodies against the virus. They want to trial remdesivir, but have not been able to obtain the stocks they need, because it is being tested in China and the US and because doctors are already prescribing it on compassionate use grounds.\nRepurposed drugs are first because they already have a proven safety record. But as experimental drugs come along, Recovery will include those. Patients are randomly allocated one of the drugs (or a placebo). There are already 500 to 900 patients on each of the drugs being tested and 2,000 in the control groups.\nThe UK trial was set up with unprecedented speed. The team went to see the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, to gain his support and enrolled the first patient nine days later. The NHS and National Institute for \n Research are on board. They recruited 1,000 patients within the first two weeks.\nMartin Landray, professor of medicine and epidemiology at the Nuffield Department of Population Health, who co-leads the trial with Horby, says it\u2019s extraordinary and may change the landscape once the pandemic is over.\n\u201cOne of the things it tells you is what can happen when everybody is incentivised to make stuff happen as opposed to dither, delay or feelings that they will get into trouble if they say no,\u201d said Prof Landray, who has worked for 20 years on cardiovascular drug trials coordinated from Oxford. After this, he thinks, it will be hard to return to the snail\u2019s pace that has been the norm for setting up clinical trials in the UK, which can sometimes take years.\nThe second extraordinary thing is that the clinical care of the patients and the scientific rigour involved in trialling the drugs are hand in hand in a way that doesn\u2019t normally happen, where the research might be going on in one corner of the hospital. \u201cFrontline clinicians don\u2019t know which treatments are best for patients apart from supportive care or ventilation,\u201d he said. That gives them massive motivation to get involved in the trial, which is central to the care of the patient.\nHorby says it\u2019s unlikely they will come up with a quick cure. \u201cWe haven\u2019t got anything like a magic bullet,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we have to temper people\u2019s expectations about these drugs. It\u2019s possible some might have an effect, but it\u2019s likely to be modest. I think what we\u2019ll be looking at in terms of making a significant impact will be moving on to combinations once we know of things that work. If we combine antiviral and anti-inflammatory drugs, they might have a bigger impact.\u201d\nHe holds out more hope for monoclonal antibodies, which worked in Ebola. \u201cIf you are saying this is an acute, serious viral infection, that\u2019s really difficult to treat, you can counter that with \u2026 well, look at Ebola. That\u2019s much nastier,\u201d he said. \u201cVery surprisingly, the monoclonal antibodies that were trialled in eastern DRC did work. Those are the ones we will be waiting for with a bit of bated breath to put into the trial when they become available.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/world-biggest-drug-trial-covid-19-uk", "title": "Coronavirus: world's biggest trial of drug to treat Covid-19 begins in UK", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 09:11:50 GMT", "summary": "<p>Scientists involved in Recovery trial, with over 5,000 test subjects, hope for answers within weeks </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The world\u2019s biggest trial of drugs to treat Covid-19 patients has been set up in the UK at unprecedented speed, and hopes to have some answers within weeks.</p><p>The <a href=\"https://www.recoverytrial.net/\">Recovery trial </a>has recruited over 5,000 patients in 165 NHS hospitals around the UK in a month, ahead of similar trials in the US and Europe, which have a few hundred.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/world-biggest-drug-trial-covid-19-uk\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/16c40017578a7cf6c11830793185535224145347/0_291_6692_4018/master/6692.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=fa1390297d00eb636fac9706b45e01a4"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/16/spacewatch-im-1-mission-takes-aim-at-moons-ocean-of-storms": {"story": "he Houston-based company Intuitive Machines has announced the intended touchdown site for its \n.

But during breeding season males have also been seen to engage in \u201c\u2018stink flirting\u201d where they rub the liquid from their wrists on to their tails before waving them at females.\n, Touhara and colleagues report that they collected samples of this liquid from the wrists of four captive male lemurs. They found that a greater volume and a more fruity, floral smell was produced during the breeding season, running from October to February. They also found females sniffed male scent marks for longer during the breeding season.\nThe team presented female lemurs with cotton pads bearing the liquid taken during the breeding and during non-breeding seasons; they found the females sniffed longer at the pads connected with the breeding period.\nA chemical analysis revealed three chemicals in the liquid that increased during the breeding season. One of the chemicals is found in various fruits and vegetables and has a \u201cgreen\u201d smell, while another is found in coriander and cucumbers and smells floral, and the third, found in aged beef, smells like pears.\nAmong further experiments the team found signs that only a mixture of these was attractive to females \u2013 and only during breeding season \u2013 while boosting the testosterone levels of a male led to higher levels of one of the odour chemicals being produced.\n\u201cWe think these pheromones are signals of male strength or dominance because the more testosterone is produced the more these odours are produced,\u201d said Touhara.\nWhile many animals, including mice, goats and all insects use pheromones, evidence for their use in primates, including humans, \n.\n\u201cAlthough there [is circumstantial evidence] that humans utilise olfactory cues for communication, there is no authentic pheromone that has been chemically identified,\u201d said Touhara. \nBut, Touhara said that that did not mean scents were unimportant to humans. \u201cThere are probably crucial odours that affect each other\u2019s emotions. For example, the baby\u2019s head smell that parents sniff and feel happy [about]. Our research really encourages people, including us, to find olfactory cues that are utilised in humans.\u201d\nTristram Wyatt, an expert in pheromones, at the University of Oxford, who was not involved in the study, said there was some evidence that humans might pick up on differences in scent between individuals. But, even if true, these would not be pheromones.\n\u201cThat is quite different from the idea of molecules that are the same in every male or every female. The whole point is it is about differences,\u201d Wyatt said. \u201cPheromones in humans are not ruled out, but the ones currently claimed are without evidence.\u201d\nHe added that while the new study could spur on research into the matter, he agreed with the authors that it was too soon to say that sex pheromones had been found in primates. The results would need to hold in larger numbers of lemurs, and be shown to actually make a difference to the likelihood of mating. \u201cIt is good and exciting [research] but very preliminary,\u201d he said.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/16/fruity-and-irresistible-male-lemurs-wrist-scent-seduces-the-girls", "title": "Fruity and irresistible: male lemurs' wrist scent seduces females", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:57:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>\u2018Stink flirting\u2019 observation may be first finding of primate sex pheromones, say scientists</p><p>An irresistible floral scent dabbed on the body may sound like a cliche from a perfume advert, but it appears to play a role in how male <a href=\"https://www.lemurworld.com/ring-tailed-lemur/\">ring-tailed lemurs</a> attract a mate.</p><p>Researchers in Japan say they have identified the odours males waft at females, and shown the latter\u2019s attention is indeed captured by the pong.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/apr/16/fruity-and-irresistible-male-lemurs-wrist-scent-seduces-the-girls\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/091e5939a703222bf6be484be17fb2ae373ecae4/0_201_3200_1921/master/3200.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=149cd79a192a71f565a6cf98b045add0"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/plasma-donations-coronavirus-patients-survivors": {"story": "ary Blumenfeld and his wife, Leann, who is pregnant, were looking forward to welcoming a new member to their family. The timing was perfect. Both of their young sons were enjoying school. Business was thriving; they had just had a record year selling real estate in Atlanta. But then, one by one, the family fell ill with Covid-19.\nIt was Leann who got sick first, then Cary. Leann\u2019s father, Steven Feldman, sent text messages and called daily to check in on them. It was around that time, too, that he began to exhibit similar symptoms to Cary. Fevers. Raging headaches. Strange taste sensations.\nJust as the Blumenfelds were beginning to recover, Steven took a turn for the worse. He started having trouble breathing. An ambulance was called, and he was intubated that same night. The doctors tried everything to clear the virus, including \n, but Steven\u2019s condition showed little signs of improvement.\nRunning out of options, Cary contacted relatives in the medical profession and began discussing the use of convalescent plasma with Steven\u2019s physicians, who advised it could be done for \n.\nConvalescent plasma is the liquid component of blood that can be collected from patients who have recovered from an infection. When somebody overcomes an illness, they produce life-saving antibodies \u2013 protective blood proteins that ward off antigens, like viruses \u2013 and those remain within the blood for a period of time (usually up to three months).\nUnder new \n, only eligible blood donors who have had a documented diagnosis of Covid-19, and remain asymptomatic for at least 14 days post-recovery, may donate their plasma.\nThe idea is that these antibodies \u201ccan give a temporary assist by interfering with the virus until that person mounts an immune response,\u201d \n.\nCary\u2019s family immediately put out a \n through a local TV station asking for people who had survived the illness to donate blood, and got hundreds of responses \u2013 three of which resulted in the first donations of this kind to be made in the south-east United States.\nBut this is not a new method. It has been tried and tested for over a hundred years on numerous illnesses, most recently for diseases such as Ebola, as well as Sars, Mers and 2009 H1N1, otherwise known as swine flu. In China, there are even \n of severely affected patients with Covid-19 who have undergone the procedure and shown some signs of recovery. However, these pilot studies have not been proven with complete certainty.\nOne \n from the state-owned Chinese pharmaceutical company Sinopharm concluded: \u201cThe optimal dose and time point, as well as the clinical benefit of convalescent plasma therapy, needs further investigation in larger well-controlled trials.\u201d\nNormally, this sort of research would take years to bring to fruition, but Dr Eldad Hod, an associate professor at Columbia University Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons, is confident that their collaboration and data-sharing arrangements with institutions such as Johns Hopkins University and the Mayo Clinic can help expedite that process.\nThis \u201cliquid gold\u201d, says DR Hod, in reference to the colour of plasma, has a wide range of potential prophylactic and medicinal uses, from preventing illness among frontline healthcare workers to treating patients in critical care units \u2013 like Steven.\nRandomised clinical trials are due to begin next week. In addition to supplies, Dr Hod estimates that the university will need to build up an inventory of 400 units of plasma in its blood banks to support this study. A single Covid-19 survivor can provide enough plasma to treat two or three other patients.\nOnce a national resource of convalescent plasma has been gathered, academic laboratories will need to work with industry partners to extract the antibodies so that they can create hyper-immune globulin, vials of purified antibodies, which are easy to ship worldwide (unlike plasma). This is already done with treatments for rabies, for example.\n\u201cIf we continue to have a supply, that might buy us time to develop new vaccines or new treatments [that can defeat the virus],\u201d he adds.\nFortunately for researchers, the supply side of the equation has been solved by \n, a growing grassroots movement of 32,000 Covid-19 patients and survivors. The group posts regular updates of blood centres accepting donations and links to clinical trials. So far, the Columbia trial has had to waitlist 2,000 respondents because their programme facilities are oversubscribed by Survivor Corps members.\n\u201cWe are flooding these programmes with volunteers,\u201d says Diana Berrent, the group\u2019s founder.\nIn mid-March, the Long Island resident woke up feeling as if she \u201chad an anvil\u201d on her chest. She saw it as her civic duty to get tested, but found it next to impossible to do so until she wrote a letter to her local council and posted it on Facebook. It wound up getting the attention of Congressman Tom Suozzi, who intervened to have her tested.\n\u201cI vowed from the beginning that if I was going to be the canary in the coalmine, I was going to be the loudest canary there was,\u201d says Diana.\nA lawyer-turned-photographer, she chronicled her journey to recovery through \n, covering everything from how to set up the perfect isolation room to a magic show her son performed outside her bedroom window.\nWe need to take the fear out of all this, says Diana. To that end, she has recorded her experiences giving blood to Columbia, Vir Biotechnologies and numerous other initiatives, all in an effort to demystify the 32-minute procedure, which she described as painless.\n\u201cIt was one of the most satisfying moments of my entire life, including getting married and having children. Not many people could say that they saved a single life in their lifetime,\u201d she adds.\nJillian Finn is a recently joined member of Survivor Corps, who contracted Covid-19 during her year abroad studying in Europe.\n\u201cYou see a lot of people on the group posting for their family and sharing pictures of them,\u201d she says. \u201cThey\u2019re asking for help, and it\u2019s really hard to hear that these horrible things are happening, so if you can donate, why wouldn\u2019t you?\u201d\nFor families like the Blumenfelds, who contracted Covid-19 at an approximate time to their loved ones, it is all the more excruciating because, in most cases, they have not surpassed the 14-day mark of being asymptomatic to qualify for a transfusion.\nIn Cary\u2019s father case, it took two days to run tests on the plasma before it was safely administered on Thursday.\n\u201cStaff at the hospital started seeing slight, slight improvements about 48 hours after the plasma treatment,\u201d Cary says. \u201cThe oxygen from the ventilator decreased by 2 to 3%. And the doctors started weaning him off his sedation medications. He opened his eyes. The nurses asked him: \u2018Do you know you\u2019re at Northside hospital?\u2019 And he nodded his head.\u201d\nAt present, the hospital is shut to visitors and none of the family has been able to be by Steven\u2019s bedside.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/16/plasma-donations-coronavirus-patients-survivors", "title": "'Liquid gold': the rush for plasma and the Covid-19 survivors who want to help", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 16:11:02 GMT", "summary": "<p>A single Covid-19 survivor can provide enough plasma to treat two or three sick patients.

In Spain, data released on Thursday suggests \n have died and in the UK, of the 4,122 deaths registered, 2,523 were men and 1,599 women.\nSo why are men more vulnerable?\n\u201cThe honest answer is none of us know what\u2019s causing the difference,\u201d said Prof Sarah Hawkes, director of the UCL Centre for Gender and Global Health.\nEarly on, smoking was suggested as a likely explanation. In China, nearly 50% of men but only about 2% of women smoke, and so underlying differences in lung health were assumed to contribute to men suffering worse symptoms and outcomes.\nThe \n was backed by a paper, \n, that found smokers made up about 12% of those with less severe symptoms, but 26% of those who ended up in intensive care or died.\nSmoking might also act as an avenue for getting infected in the first place: smokers touch their lips more and may share contaminated cigarettes.\nBehavioural factors that differ across genders may also have a role. Some studies have shown that men are \n, \n, less likely to seek medical care and more likely to ignore public health advice. These are sweeping generalisations, but across a population could place men at greater risk.\nHowever, there is a growing belief among experts that more fundamental biological factors are also at play. While there are higher proportions of male smokers in many countries \u2013 \n, 16.5% of men smoke compared with 13% of women \u2013 the differences are nowhere near as extreme as in China. But men continue to be overrepresented in Covid-19 statistics.\n\u201cThe growing observation of increased mortality in men is holding true across China, Italy, Spain. We\u2019re seeing this across very diverse countries and cultures,\u201d said Sabra Klein, a professor at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.\n\u201cWhen I see that, it makes me think that there must be something universal that\u2019s contributing to this. I don\u2019t think smoking is the leading factor.\u201d\nPrevious research, including by Klein, has revealed that men have lower innate antiviral immune responses to a range of infections including hepatitis C and HIV. Studies in mice suggest this may also be true for coronaviruses, though Covid-19 specifically has not been studied.\n\u201cTheir immune system may not initiate an appropriate response when it initially sees the virus,\u201d Klein said.\nHormones can also play a role \u2013 oestrogen has been shown to increase antiviral responses of immune cells. And many genes that regulate the immune system are encoded on the X chromosome (of which men have one, and women have two) and so it is possible that some genes involved in the immune response are more active in women than in men.\nSex differences in the immune response to Covid-19 are likely to show up in antibody surveys that are taking place across the world. Klein said she had already reviewed papers on this from Chinese teams, who have tracked blood samples from patients over the course of infection. \u201cWe can expect more on this soon,\u201d she said.\nUltimately, Hawkes said, biology, lifestyle and behaviour were all likely to play a role.\nBut it will only be possible to tease out the exact balance when sex-disaggregated data is more widely available.\nAt the time of speaking, before the latest release by the ONS, Hawkes said it was disappointing that \n had published such a breakdown for case numbers and deaths, according to figures compiled by Global Health 50/50, which Hawkes leads, and CNN. The latest data revealing significantly more male deaths in the UK adds further weight to concerns that men are more vulnerable when it comes to Covid-19.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why", "title": "Men are much more likely to die from coronavirus - but why?", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 12:45:26 GMT", "summary": "<p> Trend has been replicated in all nations, but scientists cannot yet fathom the cause</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-live-news-cases-worldwide-top-2-million-trump-doubts-china-death-toll\">Coronavirus - latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">Coronavirus - all our coverage</a><br></li></ul><p> It has been well publicised that Covid-19 discriminates by age and by underlying health conditions.</p><p>But it has become increasingly apparent that it also discriminates by sex, with the latest UK data from the Office for National Statistics revealing that men are almost twice as likely to die from the disease.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/26/men-are-much-more-likely-to-die-from-coronavirus-but-why\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ea4e14e2408811084f3806a0fd251ec2c536435f/0_0_1940_1165/master/1940.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0651ca83dfde153d125d79896e862580"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/16/spectacular-artefacts-found-as-norway-ice-patch-melts": {"story": "The retreat of a Norwegian mountain ice patch, which is melting because of climate change, has revealed a lost Viking-era mountain pass scattered with \u201cspectacular\u201d and perfectly preserved artefacts that had been dropped by the side of the road.\nThe pass, at Lendbreen in Norway\u2019s mountainous central region, first came to the attention of local archaeologists in 2011, after a woollen tunic was discovered that was later dated to the third or fourth century AD.

The flood threatens to overwhelm us all, but what do all these numbers mean? Here are eight statistics you may see, with some warnings about how much we might trust them.\n This can be a very poor reflection of the number of people who have actually been infected, as it depends crucially on the testing regime \u2013 up to 9 April, 1.3 million tests had been carried out in Germany, versus 317,000 in the UK.\n The range of \n is bewildering. The \n should be treated with caution as they only include deaths in hospital of those who have tested positive for coronavirus, and there is generally a \n of a few days or even longer. For example, while on 27 March the government announced that 926 Covid-19 deaths had so far taken place in English hospitals, \n now reports that the true figure was 1,649. The gold standard is the number of death certificates collated by the \n: it report at least 1,568 mentions of Covid-19 for all deaths up to 27 March, but this will increase as registrations come in.\n \n Graphs of accumulating deaths are shown at the daily government press conference, but they are a hopeless tool for spotting trends: we need daily counts to see whether we have reached a plateau (which will not be a \u201cpeak\u201d). But the daily counts are volatile, and so need some smoothing to bring out the underlying trends: \n uses a three-day moving average.\n This will have a vertical axis labelled 1, 10, 100, 1,000. These are useful for comparing trends, but useless for getting an impression of the magnitude of the problem.\n \n Computer models come in two types. The first tries to model the epidemic itself, by making simplified assumptions about the mechanism by which a virus spreads through a community. Key quantities, such as how many people an average case will infect, are highly uncertain at the start of an epidemic but are refined as more data is gathered. Such models have formed the basis for predicting the consequences of policy decisions in the UK.\nThe second type of model is purely empirical, fitting curves to the observed data, and making strong assumptions about the shape of the curve to extrapolate into the future. These projections need to be viewed with extreme caution since they can be extremely sensitive to a few data points. On 9 April, US organisation \n predicted an eventual 66,000 UK Covid-19 deaths but this had dropped to 37,000 three days later \u2013 it is difficult to take such modelling seriously. Model predictions should always acknowledge uncertainty, although this is rarely reported by the media.\n The number of extra deaths that will be recorded in this period, due either to Covid-19 or the lockdown, is hotly contested. Lives will be lost because of the illness, reduced medical care for everyone, domestic violence and the effects of unemployment and poverty; and lives will be saved through fewer accidents and, particularly, improved air quality. A (disputed) fraction of those dying would have died anyway in the coming year, a phenomenon known as \n. But the overall effect is hard to predict, and confident claims should be treated with scepticism.\n These vary dramatically with age and frailty, just as \u201cnormal\u201d risks do. In fact the current estimates for the general public (rather than healthcare workers) seem remarkably similar to the \n \u2013 but all packed into a few weeks.\n Even apparently accurate antibody tests can lead to many \n. But a less accurate test may be fine if we are testing a representative sample to estimate the proportion of a population who have immunity.\nFinally, it\u2019s tempting to link a country\u2019s statistics to the measures they have taken to control the virus: for example, has Sweden\u2019s more relaxed policy been as effective as lockdown? But countries differ in so many ways: basic demographics, compliance and social networks, testing capacity and policy, health service characteristics and so on.

Within three days, the doctors saw improvements in the patients\u2019 symptoms, ranging from shortness of breath and chest pains to fever and coughs.\nXiaoming Yang, from the National Engineering Technology Research Center for Combined Vaccines in Wuhan, described the treatment as a \u201cpromising rescue option\u201d for severely ill patients, but cautioned that a larger randomised trial was needed to confirm the findings. Details of the pilot study are reported in \n.\nAnother team of doctors led by Lei Liu, from Shenzhen Third People\u2019s hospital, gave convalescent plasma to five critically ill patients. All showed improved symptoms after the infusions and within 10 days, three patients were able to come off the ventilators that had been keeping them alive, according to a preliminary report in the \n.\nThe findings raise hopes that donated blood from recently recovered patients could be used to boost the immune systems of more vulnerable people and help them fight the infection. But with only a small number of patients so far treated with plasma, and the infusions given outside of formal trials, it is impossible to know how much benefit the treatment really brings.\nConvalescent plasma treatments date back to before the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic. The therapy relies on the fact that people who have recovered from a viral infection have antibodies in their blood that can rapidly detect and destroy the virus the next time it attacks. Infusing the plasma into patients, and potentially into people at risk of being infected, can boost their immune systems and potentially provide protection.\nHints that the therapy may help have prompted \n in the outbreak in New York and similar studies are expected to start in the UK in the coming weeks. Britain\u2019s national blood service has begun screening blood from patients to find plasma rich in antibodies to use in those trials.\nProfessor David Tappin, a senior research fellow at the University of Glasgow, has applied to the UK\u2019s National Institute for \n Research to run two clinical trials with convalescent plasma. They will look for evidence that plasma can protect frontline workers from infection, prevent patients from deteriorating and needing ventilation in intensive care units, and improve the condition of those who are already severely ill.\nTappin said the cases reported from Wuhan were important because they suggested that giving plasma to severely ill patients appeared to be safe. \u201cThe outcomes are also encouraging for these patients,\u201d he said. But he added that to be sure plasma improved on the natural course of the disease, and that it was safe in larger groups of patients, formal trials had to take place. \nProfessor Munir Pirmohamed, the president of the British Pharmacological Society, echoed the need to be cautious about the Wuhan cases. \u201cThis was not a randomised trial and all patients also received other treatments including antivirals such as remdesivir, which are currently in trials for Covid-19,\u201d he said.\n\u201cIt is also important to remember that there are potential safety concerns with convalescent plasma, including transmission of other agents and antibody enhancement of disease,\u201d he added. \u201cEven if shown to work, scalability to treat large numbers of patients may become an issue.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/plasma-from-coronavirus-survivors-found-to-help-severely-ill-patients", "title": "Plasma from coronavirus survivors found to help severely ill patients", "published": "Tue, 07 Apr 2020 13:22:04 GMT", "summary": "<p>Blood transfusion studies by teams in China report striking improvements</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Doctors have found tentative evidence that seriously ill coronavirus patients can benefit from infusions of blood plasma collected from people who have recovered from the disease.</p><p> <span>Related: </span><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/07/wellcome-trust-urges-firms-to-donate-6bn-for-covid-19-research\">Wellcome Trust urges firms to donate \u00a36bn for Covid-19 research</a> </p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/07/plasma-from-coronavirus-survivors-found-to-help-severely-ill-patients\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/12b82286a2dca26b4bc00b864ffd5dde1238619f/22_67_3291_1975/master/3291.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=3a918e89861fa1c9a5d6992fc7930403"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/17/new-uk-taskforce-to-help-develop-and-roll-out-coronavirus-vaccine": {"story": "The government has announced a new vaccines taskforce to help the development of a vaccine for Covid-19 and ensure its rapid production and rollout if one arrives.\nThe business secretary, \n, also gave details of cash grants for work into both vaccines and potential treatments.

They have to get on and process this stuff because livelihoods are at stake.\u201d\nBailey said one way of speeding up the process would be for the government to underwrite 100% of the loans, which are interest-free for 12 months, but insisted this was a matter for the chancellor, \n, to decide.\n\u201cThe chancellor needs to make that decision because the public purse is at risk,\u201d Bailey said.\nVery small firms made up a high proportion of the loan applications and the question was whether the system would be unblocked if the Treasury took all the risk. UK Finance, the bank industry lobby group, said this week that 21% of the 28,460 formal CBILS applications had so far been approved. However, more than 300,000 firms have reportedly made informal inquiries \n, which is part of the government\u2019s wider business support package worth \u00a3330bn.\nFigures from the US suggest that American banks have been much quicker than those in the UK to provide loans to small companies to help them through the lockdown.

Several versions are known to trigger common colds and more recently two types have set off outbreaks of deadly illnesses: severe acute respiratory syndrome (Sars) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (Mers).\nBut their impact has been mild compared with the global havoc unleashed by the coronavirus that is causing the Covid-19 pandemic. In only a few months it has triggered lockdowns in dozens of nations and claimed \n And the disease continues to spread.\nThat is an extraordinary achievement for a spiky ball of genetic material coated in fatty chemicals called lipids, and which measures 80 billionths of a metre in diameter. Humanity has been brought low by a very humble assailant.\nOn the other hand, our knowledge about the Sars-CoV-2, the virus that causes Covid-19, is also remarkable. This was an organism unknown to science five months ago. Today it is the subject of study on an unprecedented scale. \n antiviral drug trials have been launched and new diagnostic tests are appearing. \nThe questions are therefore straightforward: what have we learned over the past five months and how might that knowledge put an end to this pandemic?\nThe Sars-CoV-2 virus almost certainly \n which have evolved fierce immune responses to viruses, researchers have discovered. These defences drive viruses to replicate faster so that they can get past bats\u2019 immune defences. In turn, that transforms the bat into \n viruses. Then when these bat viruses move into other mammals, creatures that lack a fast-response immune system, the viruses quickly spread into their new hosts. Most evidence suggests that Sars-CoV-2 started infecting humans via an intermediary species, such as pangolins.\n\u201cThis virus probably jumped from a bat into another animal, and that other animal was probably near a human, maybe in a market,\u201d says virologist Professor Edward Holmes of Sydney University. \u201cAnd so if that wildlife animal has a virus it\u2019s picked up from a bat and we\u2019re interacting with it, there\u2019s a good chance that the virus will then spread to the person handling the animal. Then that person will go home and spread it to someone else and we have an outbreak.\u201d\nAs to the transmission of Sars-CoV-2, that occurs when droplets of water containing the virus are expelled by an infected person in a cough or sneeze.\nVirus-ridden particles are inhaled by others and come into contact with cells lining the throat and larynx. These cells have large numbers of receptors \u2013 known as Ace-2 receptors \u2013 on their surfaces. (Cell receptors play a key role in passing chemicals into cells and in triggering signals between cells.) \u201cThis virus has a surface protein that is primed to lock on that receptor and slip its RNA into the cell,\u201d says virologist Professor Jonathan Ball of Nottingham University.\nOnce inside, that RNA inserts itself into the cell\u2019s own replication machinery and makes multiple copies of the virus. These burst out of the cell, and the infection spreads. Antibodies generated by the body\u2019s immune system eventually target the virus and in most cases halt its progress.\n\u201cA Covid-19 infection is generally mild, and that really is the secret of the virus\u2019s success,\u201d adds Ball. \u201cMany people don\u2019t even notice they have got an infection and so go around their work, homes and supermarkets infecting others.\u201d\nBy contrast, Sars \u2013 which is also caused by a coronavirus \u2013 makes patients much sicker and kills about one in 10 of those infected. In most cases, these patients are hospitalised and that stops them infecting others \u2013 by cutting the transmission chain. Milder Covid-19 avoids that issue.\nOccasionally, however, the virus can cause severe problems. This happens when it moves down the respiratory tract and infects the lungs, which are even richer in cells with Ace-2 receptors. Many of these cells are destroyed, and lungs become congested with bits of broken cell. In these cases, patients will require treatment in intensive care.\nEven worse, in some cases, a person\u2019s immune system goes into overdrive, attracting cells to the lungs in order to attack the virus, resulting in inflammation. This process can run out of control, more immune cells pour in, and the inflammation gets worse. This is known as a \n (In Greek, \u201ccyto\u201d means cell and \u201ckino\u201d means movement.) In some cases, this can kill the patient.\nJust why cytokine storms occur in some patients but not in the vast majority is unclear. One possibility is that some people have versions of Ace-2 receptors that are slightly more vulnerable to attacks from the coronavirus than are those of most people.\nDoctors examining patients recovering from a Covid-19 infection are finding fairly high levels of neutralising antibodies in their blood. These \n, and they coat an invading virus at specific points, blocking its ability to break into cells.\n\u201cIt is clear that immune responses are being mounted against Covid-19 in infected people,\u201d says virologist Mike Skinner of Imperial College London. \u201cAnd the antibodies created by that response will provide protection against future infections \u2013 but we should note that it is unlikely this protection will be for life.\u201d\nInstead, most virologists believe that immunity against Covid-19 will last only a year or two. \u201cThat is in line with other coronaviruses that infect humans,\u201d says Skinner. \u201cThat means that even if most people do eventually become exposed to the virus, it is still likely to become endemic \u2013 which means we would see seasonal peaks of infection of this disease. We will have reached a steady state with regard to Covid-19.\u201d\nThe virus will be with us for some time, in short. But could it change its virulence? Some researchers have suggested that it could become less deadly. Others have argued that it could mutate to become more lethal. Skinner is doubtful. \u201cWe have got to consider this pandemic from the virus\u2019s position,\u201d he says. \u201cIt is spreading round the world very nicely. It is doing OK. Change brings it no benefit.\u201d\nIn the end, it will be the development and roll-out of an effective vaccine that will free us from the threat of Covid-19, Skinner says.\nLast Friday, the \n had been launched round the globe \u2013 with a further 37 in development. Among the projects that are under way is a vaccine programme that is now in phase-one trials at Oxford University, two others at US biotechnology corporations and three more at Chinese scientific groups. Many other vaccine developers say they plan to start human testing this year.\nThis remarkable response raises \n in a fairly short time. However, vaccines require large-scale safety and efficacy studies. Thousands of people would receive either the vaccine itself or a placebo to determine if the former were effective at preventing infection from the virus which they would have encountered naturally. That, inevitably, is a lengthy process.\nAs a result, some scientists have proposed a way to speed up the process \u2013 by deliberately exposing volunteers to the virus to determine a vaccine\u2019s efficacy. \u201cThis approach is not without risks but has the potential to expedite candidate vaccine testing by many months,\u201d says Nir Eyal, a professor of bioethics at Rutgers University.\nVolunteers would have to be young and healthy, he stresses: \u201cTheir health would also be closely monitored, and they would have access to intensive care and any available medicines.\u201d The result could be a vaccine that would save millions of lives by being ready for use in a much shorter time than one that went through standard phase three trials.\nBut deliberately infecting people \u2013 in particular volunteers who would be given a placebo vaccine as part of the trial \u2013 is controversial. \u201cThis will have to be thought through very carefully,\u201d says Professor Adam Finn of Bristol University. \u201cYoung people might jump at the opportunity to join such a trial but this is a virus that does kill the odd young person. We don\u2019t know why yet. However, phase-three trials are still some way off, so we have time to consider the idea carefully.\u201d\n This article was amended on 12 April 2020.

How did it get to a food market in Wuhan, China, from where it is thought to have spilled over into humans? The answers to these questions are gradually being pieced together, and the story they tell makes for uncomfortable reading.\nLet\u2019s start at the beginning. As of 17 March, we know that the Sars-CoV-2 virus (a member of the coronavirus family that causes the respiratory illness Covid-19) is the product of natural evolution. \n, conducted by infectious disease expert Kristian G Andersen of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, California, and colleagues, rules out the possibility that it could have been manufactured in a lab or otherwise engineered.

That animal was probably one that some Chinese people like to eat, and that is therefore sold in \u201cwet\u201d markets (those that sell fresh meat, fish, seafood and other produce). This animal may have been the scaly mammal called a pangolin. That can\u2019t be conclusively proved, but several groups have found sequence similarities between Sars-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses that infect pangolins.\nIf this is indeed the route the virus took to humans, it has two critical interfaces: one between us and the intermediate host, possibly a pangolin, and one between that host and bats. Most of the attention so far has been focused on the interface between humans and the intermediate host, with fingers of blame being pointed at Chinese wet markets and eating habits, but both interfaces were required for the pandemic to ignite. So where and how did the spillover from the bat to the pangolin \u2013 or other wild or semi-wild intermediate host \u2013 occur?\n\u201cOur study does not directly shed light on the geographical origin of the virus,\u201d says Andersen. \u201cHowever, all the available evidence shows that it was inside China.\u201d\nCase closed then, and President Trump is right to \n. Well, no, because if you want to understand why this pandemic happened now and not, say, 20 years ago \u2013 since Chinese people\u2019s taste for what we in the west consider exotic fare is not new \u2013 you have to include a number of other factors. \u201cWe can blame the object \u2013 the virus, the cultural practice \u2013 but causality extends out into the relationships between people and ecology,\u201d says evolutionary biologist Rob Wallace of the Agroecology and Rural Economics Research Corps in St Paul, Minnesota.\nStarting in the 1990s, as part of its economic transformation, China ramped up its food production systems to industrial scale. One side effect of this, \n, was that smallholding farmers were undercut and pushed out of the livestock industry. Searching for a new way to earn a living, some of them turned to farming \u201cwild\u201d species that had previously been eaten for subsistence only. Wild food was formalised as a sector, and was increasingly branded as a luxury product. But the smallholders weren\u2019t only pushed out economically. As industrial farming concerns took up more and more land, these small-scale farmers were pushed out geographically too \u2013 closer to uncultivable zones. Closer to the edge of the forest, that is, where bats and the viruses that infect them lurk. The density and frequency of contacts at that first interface increased, and hence, so did the risk of a spillover.\nIt\u2019s true, in other words, that an expanding human population pushing into previously undisturbed ecosystems has contributed to the increasing number of zoonoses \u2013 human infections of animal origin \u2013 in recent decades. That has been documented for Ebola and HIV, for example. But behind that shift has been another, in the way food is produced. Modern models of agribusiness are contributing to the emergence of zoonoses.\nTake flu, a disease that is considered to have high pandemic potential, having caused an estimated 15 pandemics in the past 500 years. \u201cThere is clearly a link between the emergence of highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses and intensified poultry production systems,\u201d says spatial epidemiologist Marius Gilbert of the Universit\u00e9 Libre de Bruxelles in Belgium.\nThe reasons, many of which were documented in Wallace\u2019s 2016 book \n, include the density with which chickens, turkeys or other poultry are packed into factory farms, and the fact that the birds in a given farm tend to be near genetic clones of one another \u2013 having been selected over decades for desirable traits such as lean meat. If a virus gets introduced into such a flock, it can race through it without meeting any resistance in the form of genetic variants that prevent its spread. Both experimental manipulations and observations in the real world have demonstrated that this process can result in a ratcheting up of the virus\u2019s virulence. If it then spills over into humans, we are potentially in trouble.\nIn \n, Gilbert\u2019s group reviewed historical \u201cconversion events\u201d, as they call them \u2013 when a not-very-pathogenic avian flu strain became much more dangerous, and found that most of them had occurred in commercial poultry systems, and more frequently in wealthy countries. Europe, Australia and the US had generated more of them than China.\nThat doesn\u2019t let China off the hook. Two highly pathogenic forms of avian flu \u2013 H5N1 and H7N9 \u2013 have emerged in that country in recent decades. Both infect humans, though not easily (yet). The first human cases of H7N9 were reported in 2013, and there were small annual outbreaks thereafter. But, says Gilbert, \u201cnothing was done until the virus turned out to be pathogenic for chickens as well. Then it became an important economic issue and China started to mass-vaccinate its poultry against H7N9, and that ended the transmission to humans.\u201d\nChina is one of the world\u2019s \n, but its poultry industry is not wholly Chinese-owned. After the recession of 2008, for example, New York-based investment bank Goldman Sachs diversified its holdings and \n. So if China has its share of responsibility for spillover events, it isn\u2019t alone. That is why Wallace insists on talking about relational geographies rather than absolute geographies, when it comes to identifying the causes of disease. Or as he puts it: \u201cFollow the money.\u201d\nNot everybody sees a straightforward link between factory farming and new and dangerous forms of flu. Michael Worobey, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Arizona, points out that before they were brought into factory farms, poultry were kept outside. The factory model may ramp up virulence, he says, but it probably protects a flock from being infected by a virus in the first place.\nStill, Worobey doesn\u2019t doubt that farming and other human-animal interactions have shaped our disease ecology. His group collects the sequences of flu viruses from a range of animal hosts, including humans, and plots them on a family treeto try to understand how flu has evolved over time. Flu is constantly mutating \u2013 that\u2019s the reason the seasonal flu vaccine has to be updated each year \u2013 but it mutates at different rates in different hosts, which means that his flu family tree is informative both about the parentage and intermediate host of each strain and about the approximate timing of past spillover events.\nIt\u2019s possible \u2013 though by no means certain \u2013 that flu first became a disease of humans after the Chinese domesticated ducks about 4,000 years ago \u2013 drawing that animal reservoir into human communities for the first time. But humans can also catch flu from, and give flu to, pigs \u2013 another animal we have lived alongside for millennia. \n \u2013 controversially \u2013 that birds might not always have been the main intermediate host for human flu viruses. Until about a century ago, he reported, people may have caught flu from horses. Around the time that motor vehicles supplanted horses as transport, poultry farming was expanding in the western hemisphere, and it\u2019s possible, Worobey argued, that birds then took over as the main intermediate host of flu for humans.\nNot everyone buys that scenario. Wendy Barclay, a virologist at Imperial College London, says that if horses were once the main intermediate host for flu, \u201cmost avian viruses would contain the mammalian adaptation\u201d, and they don\u2019t. David Morens of the US National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases in Bethesda, Maryland, thinks that it is more likely that the horse was a temporary detour, and that the main intermediate host of flu for humans has always been birds \u2013 especially wild ones. But all agree that humans have shaped these host-pathogen relationships, through our use of land and other animal species. And as Worobey points out, the sheer size of the human population today means that in the 21st century, we are doing so on an unprecedented scale. He estimates, for example, that domesticated ducks probably outnumber wild ones by now.\nAnd we\u2019re not just talking about birds. Gilbert believes a ratcheting up of viral virulence is happening in pig herds, too. Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS), a disease of pigs that was \n, has since spread to herds across the worldand strains detected recently in China are more virulent than the early American ones. \n carried out by Martha Nelson of the US National Institutes of Health and colleagues mapped the genetic sequences of swine flu viruses and found that Europe and the US \u2013 the largest global exporters of pigs \u2013 are also the largest exporters of swine flu.\nThere have been claims on social media, sometimes posted by vegans, that if we ate less meat there would have been no Covid-19. Interestingly, some of these have been \n as \u201cpartly false\u201d. But the claims are also partly true. Though the links they draw are too simplistic, the evidence is now strong that the way meat is produced \u2013 and not just in China \u2013 contributed to Covid-19.\nIt is clear that to prevent or at least slow the emergence of new zoonoses, as Fearnley and Lynteris have argued, China\u2019s wet markets will need to be better regulated. But we also need to look behind those markets, at how our food is produced globally.\nThough it may not feel like it now, Wallace says, we have been lucky with Sars-CoV-2. It appears to be far less lethal that either H7N9 \u2013 which kills around a third of those it infects \u2013 or H5N1, which kills even more. This gives us an opportunity, he says, to question our lifestyle choices \u2013 because chicken isn\u2019t cheap if it costs a million lives \u2013 and vote for politicians who hold agribusiness to higher standards of ecological, social and epidemiological sustainability. \u201cHopefully,\u201d he says, \u201cthis will change our notions about agricultural production, land use and conservation.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/28/is-factory-farming-to-blame-for-coronavirus", "title": "Is factory farming to blame for coronavirus?", "published": "Sat, 28 Mar 2020 18:00:32 GMT", "summary": "<p>Scientists are tracing the path of Sars-CoV-2 from a wild animal host \u2013 but we need to look at the part played in the outbreak by industrial food production</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>Where did the virus causing the current pandemic come from?

By mid week it was clear I wasn\u2019t coping after six weeks in iso. I mean, I thought I was coping, so my column this week was meant to be on the joys of acceptance and stillness. I thought I was there, at the final zen stage. After that, I was going to retire, bitch.\nThat was until I woke up on Wednesday to find my iso buddy had left his dishes in the sink overnight. WTF, man. Wash everything. Leave nothing on the bench overnight! DO YOU WANT THE MICE TO COME AS WELL AS THE PLAGUE?? Normally I wouldn\u2019t care, normally I leave dirty dishes in the sink, but something in me snapped \u2013 hard. I was filled with a deep, sudden and volcanic rage. I was a \n. I\u2019m not proud of this, but in the surge of anger and energy running through me, I picked up the dirty dishes and smashed them in the sink. Glasses, a bowl and some ceramic thing that I quite liked, shattered. In the process I cut my hands on the broken glass \u2013 but I DIDN\u2019T CARE!! THERE WERE DIRTY DISHES IN THE SINK AND I WAS ANGRY.\nMy hand, bleeding now, but my anger not spent, propelled me outside where I picked up the empty washing basket, which was made from a heavy, durable plastic. I hurled the basket with great force towards an outside wall, which not only caused the plastic to shatter but an arch of blood to spray from my hand through the air. Plastic shards and blood rained from the sky. The urge to primal scream was strong.\nInstead I took my bleeding hand inside \u2013 not even feeling pain yet, just a slight dissipation of rage and also curiosity about it (what the hell just happened? Am I \u2026 losing it?) and went to reply to an email before realising I was still bleeding \u2013 all over the keyboard.\nI sat outside and waited to calm down \u2013 but still the rage was there. An old Smashing Pumpkins lyric took on an eerie, fresh meaning: \u201cDespite all my rage/ I am still just a rat in a cage.\u201d\nMy hand had stopped bleeding but was now throbbing, as I thought of all the introverts, happy at home, quilting and darning their socks by the fire \u2013 never wanting this to end ever. They like their cage. But I want out.\nMy mate Trav called. I told him about the rage. He laughed. He had been there last week. \u201cIt\u2019s rock bottom, dude, but that\u2019s the worst it will get \u2013 and from here, you\u2019ll feel better.\u201d\nPure anger and rage are not emotions I experience frequently \u2013 they are once-a-year things that come from nowhere and always stun me with their enormous surge of energy and power and the way they scramble things in their aftermath. Pure rage shifts things quickly. Directed at another person in full throttle it can alter the relationship irrevocably. Atoms and patterns shift around it. Rage can also have an immensely clarifying effect. In its wave you suddenly become viscerally aware of your limits and feeling.

He didn\u2019t see anger as a flaw indigenous to those of volatile character but as something that anyone, even the most chilled person, is susceptible to.\nHe wrote of plagues and anger:\nSeneca recognised that anger is the one emotion that has its own intense forward momentum and is difficult to control. Once logic and reason reassert their grip it\u2019s almost always too late: the plates have been smashed, the words have been said, the damage has been done.\nInstead the Stoic advice was to strive to maintain a baseline tranquil state. \u201cThere is no more reliable proof of greatness,\u201d wrote Seneca, \u201cthan to be in a state where nothing can happen to make you disturbed.\u201d\nIt\u2019s not the end of isolation I should be looking forward to \u2013 instead stillness and tranquility is the place I need to get to in the end.\n Brigid Delaney is a Guardian Australia columnist\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/17/i-thought-i-was-coping-in-isolation-but-this-week-something-in-me-snapped", "title": "I thought I was coping in isolation but this week something in me snapped | Brigid Delaney", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:30:13 GMT", "summary": "<p>Introverts may be happy at home with their quilting and sourdough but I\u2019m angry \u2013 I want out!</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/newsletters/2020/mar/28/sign-up-for-guardian-australias-daily-coronavirus-email?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Sign up for Guardian Australia\u2019s daily coronavirus email</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/ng-interactive/2018/may/15/the-guardian-app?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Download the free Guardian app to get the most important news notifications</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/ng-interactive/2020/mar/26/how-many-cases-of-coronavirus-are-there-in-australia-live-covid-19-numbers-and-statistics?CMP=cvau_sfl\">Coronavirus Australia maps and cases: live numbers and statistics</a></li></ul><p>When <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/apr/14/australians-are-as-happy-as-before-coronavirus-lockdown-guardian-essential-poll-finds\">a poll came out</a> during the week that said Australians reported the same levels of happiness as before the pandemic (albeit with a few more financial worries), I thought, \u201cHow can that be?\u201d After all, everything fun has been replaced by JIGSAW PUZZLES.</p><p>It would make more sense if the survey averaged out the responses \u2013 because from my own casting around, people\u2019s moods vary widely, according to innate temperament.

Strikingly, these firms account for only 3% of all care homes. The true death rate in the UK\u2019s care homes, and in the country overall, could be much higher.\nTesting is a \n of any public health response to an epidemic, and a key way to reduce deaths. And in UK laboratories, we now have the capacity to test tens of thousands of samples. Yet, Sir Patrick Vallance, the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, recently \n that the UK has not been increasing its testing capacity quickly enough. And Prof Chris Whitty, England\u2019s chief medical officer, said Germany \u2013 which can now test more than 500,000 people a week \u2013 \u201c\n\u201d in its ability to test for coronavirus. Indeed, \n show that while our cumulative deaths climbed from 4,900 on 5 April to almost 13,000 today, the number of tests carried out in the UK has stagnated at about 12,000.\nWhen health secretary Matt Hancock visited our Milton Keynes laboratory last Thursday, he avowed that our jobs were crucial, and thanked us for our service. Our workplace, where we test patient samples for the virus, has been called the \u201c\n\u201d, with capacity to process more than 5,000 swabs, eventually projected to reach 30,000 swabs per day. And yet at our testing centre on Tuesday this week, we processed just over 1,000 samples. The day before, the total was 1,300, and three days ago 1,800.\nOur shifts were meant to be excruciating 12-hour marathons. In reality, they are rather more like laid-back morning jogs. Dozens of academics and laboratory personnel from all over the UK languish in a hotel with nothing to do. Millions of pounds of equipment borrowed from universities and companies rests silently in the evening hours, when the noise of our collective toil should be deafening.\nThe problem does not lie in the laboratories, or the personnel. The UK has an army of skilled researchers at its disposal. More than 1,200 scientists had volunteered their expertise in the fight against coronavirus \n by early April. Dozens signed up to help in Milton Keynes. The equipment and reagents are all available, now that Thermo Fisher Scientific has \n with all the testing kits it needs. And \u201cscale up\u201d has been the mantra at Milton Keynes since I arrived last Monday. We were promised 5,000 samples \u201cto begin with\u201d. We never saw those numbers. They told us we should prepare for a 24-hour operation, but we are done in four or five.\nDisappointment abounds \u2013 and understandably so: all the staff, volunteers and managers have mobilised in an unprecedented manner for the mission. They created a world-class Covid-19 diagnostic centre from scratch in a couple of weeks, with precise protocols, standard operating procedures and training expertise to go with it. The tests are accurate, quality control checks are run daily and improvements constantly implemented. The lab continues to scale up and expand, with new robots and automated procedures coming online every day. The expertise and dedication of the frontline staff and management is truly commendable. It is proof of the excellence of the UK bioscience sector.\nSo, what is the problem? Where is the bottleneck? Maybe it is simply that fewer people were tested over the Easter weekend. But the virus does not respect holidays. Some days, we have been told that more than 4,000 swabs were offered, but people did not take advantage of them. Fine \u2013 but surely those swabs could be repurposed, and the spare capacity redirected? And even if test numbers do pick up today, or tomorrow, the rate of increase is far too slow for both the scale of this emergency and what our laboratories can handle\nWe are all being let down by a government that may have decided testing is, after all, not that important, despite the successful examples set by South Korea and Germany. On 12 April, the United States performed 140,000 tests. Italy more than 48,000. Turkey 35,000. Germany is averaging 50,000 a day. In the UK, total tests numbered just short of \n on Tuesday. Just in our lab, we could have easily done 8,000.

It declared the coronavirus a public health emergency on 30 January, while Mr Trump played down the outbreak repeatedly, failed to prepare his country and only declared a national emergency on 13 March. Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the WHO, warned of \u201calarming levels of inaction\u201d from many countries. So far 25,000 Americans have died.\nMr Trump\u2019s attack is of a piece with his hostility to multilateral organisations, and frequent though inconsistent assaults on \n. In January, he praised Beijing\u2019s hard work and transparency regarding the virus. This week, he called the WHO \u201cvery China-centric\u201d, though US disengagement will surely make it more so.\nThe WHO has handled the coronavirus\u2019s emergence more nimbly than it did Ebola, reflecting the reforms made in the wake of that \n response. But there is concern about the praise it has lavished on China and its leadership despite the anxieties over human rights, the length of time it took China to confirm human-to-human transmission and the cover-up of the scale and seriousness of the outbreak in Wuhan by authorities, which allowed Covid-19\u2019s spread within China and abroad.\nThe organisation has\n appallingly, thanks to its concern for relations with Beijing. China regards the self-ruled island as a renegade province and has blocked its membership of the body. The leadership cannot change that. But Taipei has accused the WHO of failing to pass on its early warning that the virus might be transmitted between humans. It has \n, and Dr Tedros launched a \n on the democracy, saying he had received racist slurs from Taiwan and that \u201cthe foreign ministry didn\u2019t disassociate\u201d itself from them. (Taiwan says the charge is baseless.)\nBut suggesting that WHO officials are in thrall to China is a facile explanation. The WHO is a membership organisation, with responsibility but not power. It can try to steer member states, but has no sanctions; without sticks, it relies on carrots. It needs China\u2019s cooperation \u2013 not least because the precise origins of coronavirus within Wuhan remain unclear. It took weeks to get WHO investigators into the country. It is also true that China told the WHO of the strange pneumonia cases within a couple of weeks, and its scientists published the virus\u2019s genome sequence by 9 January \u2013 a far cry from its months-long cover-up of Sars.\nOther countries should press the WHO to think carefully about how enthusiastically it endorses Chinese actions. They should vigorously make the case for Taiwan\u2019s renewed attendance at the World \n Assembly as an observer, even if China will continue to resist. They should foster their own relationships with Taipei, individually and together. Taiwan\u2019s response to the virus has been exemplary; others will benefit from its experience and information.\nBut they also need to support the WHO. Mr Trump\u2019s unconscionable decision threatens its status, and the ability of public health experts to collaborate internationally without fearing the political consequences. It will punish those \n to Covid-19. The attacks on the WHO and China from the US, \n and elsewhere reflect not only anger at Beijing\u2019s responsibility for this pandemic, and a belief that coronavirus has exposed the state\u2019s essential nature, but also a wish to divert attention from unpardonable failings by western governments. They, too, must take responsibility.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/the-guardian-view-on-the-who-and-coronavirus-trumps-blame-game", "title": "The Guardian view on the WHO and coronavirus: Trump\u2019s blame game | Editorial", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 18:25:03 GMT", "summary": "<p>Cutting off funds to the international body will only punish those most vulnerable to Covid-19</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/politics/live/2020/apr/15/uk-coronavirus-live-government-lockdown-exit-strategy-covid-19-latest-updates\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The buck, once more, stops somewhere else.

According to conventional wisdom, the crisis may ease in a few months, when some of the antiviral medicines on trial succeed. In a few years\u2019 time, when a vaccine becomes available, we may eradicate the virus altogether.\nYet it\u2019s unlikely that this is how the pandemic will actually play out. Although there is every indication that \n may soon emerge, the mere fact of their existence is no guarantee that people will be able to access them. In fact, Covid-19 is more likely to end in the same way that every pandemic ends: treatments and vaccines will be buried in a thicket of patents \u2013 and \n will ultimately make the decisions about who lives and who dies.\nWe typically think of monopolies, where companies exert exclusive control over a commodity, as market failures that can be corrected with antitrust laws. Medical patents are the equivalent of legalised monopolies. In theory, patents are supposed to grant pharmaceutical companies a reward for investing in research and development. Crucially, they\u2019re supposed to be temporary, lasting for \n. But in practice, patenting minor tweaks to a formula can extend this term considerably, foreclosing market competition and granting pharmaceutical companies the power to set prices.\nIn 1996, a treatment for HIV/Aids was \n in the US by a clutch of pharmaceutical companies. The treatment, a combination of antiretroviral medicines, turned a virus that was a death sentence into a chronic condition. It\nwas priced annually at \u00a36,500 per person \u2013 in most parts of the world, this price was the same in practice as having no treatment at all. It took until 2004, after millions of people had died from the illness, for India and South Africa to afford the treatment.\nAlready we\u2019ve seen how medical monopolies have restricted access to coronavirus treatments. We know, for example, that health workers don\u2019t have enough \n; less well known is that 3M holds more than 400 patents for respiratory protection, severely restricting who can produce and supply them in the US. Politicians have called on \n during the pandemic so production can be increased. Amidst an acute shortage of tests for Covid-19, a French diagnostic manufacturer submitted a test kit to the US FDA for emergency approval to sell it in the country\nand was \n by a subsidiary of Softbank (this was \n).\nAnd most of the promising treatments for coronavirus that are being tested in clinical trials have patents attached to them. Some of these, such as \n, which is used to treat influenza, and the combination of Iopinavir and ritonavir, sold under the brand name \n to treat HIV/Aids, have short-term patents in force. \n, a medicine developed for Ebola by the biotechnology company Gilead, has major patents across the world that last until 2038. Last month, Gilead rushed to secure \u201corphan drug\u201d status in the US for Remdesivir\u2019s potential use against Covid-19. Orphan status grants companies government incentives to to develop medicines for rare diseases that would otherwise be unprofitable, yet Covid-19 is quite the opposite of a rare disease. The company later \n.\nThere is every possibility that a Covid-19 vaccine will be encumbered with multiple patents.\nVaccines are now a big business. Take infant mortality caused by pneumonia, for example. The two vaccines in use today are buried in a thicket of patents belonging to Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. India uses the \n, which retails at $250 for a full course but is available to the government at a discounted rate of \u00a38 through GAVI, the Vaccine Alliance funding. But given that demand in India runs into the tens of millions, even the subsidised cost is unaffordable, and only a small fraction of babies end up getting the vaccine. And so, 40 years after a vaccine for pneumonia was developed, \n continue to die from it every year, while the vaccine they can\u2019t afford continues to generate \u00a34.5bn for Pfizer annually.\nIt\u2019s no surprise that countries are taking pre-emptive measures to deal with monopoly control over medical treatments.\nCompulsory licensing of patents \u2013 a legal measure by which countries can suspend patents on a product \u2013 is gaining popularity. Last month, Chile declared that the pandemic justifies the use of compulsory licensing; others soon followed. Israel issued compulsory licenses for lopinavir and ritonavir, Ecuador approved a resolution that asks the minister of health to issue compulsory licences over all patents related to Covid-19, Canada and Germany amended their patent laws to enable the swift grant of a compulsory licence, and Brazil is in the process of amending its patent law to make compulsory licensing easier.\nThese measures are useful, but they require each country to go it alone. And patents are not the only thing preventing access to coronavirus treatments. Costa Rica recently \n to the World Health Organization for a global Covid-19 technology pool \u2013 a place where all the necessary intellectual property, such as patents, designs, trade secrets and software could be brought together. The pool would encourage governments to share innovations and make them available globally. The Covid-19 technology pool is far from a done deal, but support for it is growing. Policymakers in the Netherlands and the UK recently threw their weight behind the idea and the director-general of the WHO welcomed Costa Rica\u2019s proposal, while UNITAID has pledged to finance it.\nGiven that this is a pandemic, it may well be that no corporation can afford to wield the stick for a Covid-19 monopoly. If Covid-19 treatments were free from monopoly control, we would have a real shot at reaching everyone. If this happens \u2013 and it\u2019s still a big if \u2013 we might realise that such a pharmaceutical system is not only what we need to survive Covid-19, but also what we need to survive other diseases.\n Achal Prabhala is a Shuttleworth Fellow and the co-ordinator of the AccessIBSA project, which campaigns for access to medicines in India, Brazil and South Africa.\n Ellen \u2018t Hoen is the director of Medicines Law & Policy, a researcher at the University Medical Centre Groningen, and a founder of the Medicines Patent Pool.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/coronavirus-treatment-drug-companies", "title": "We'll find a treatment for coronavirus \u2013 but drug companies will decide who gets it", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 11:55:40 GMT", "summary": "<p>Pharmaceutical giants will bury treatments in a thicket of patents, making them unaffordable to the world\u2019s poorest</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>How will the Covid-19 pandemic end?

It felt odd for him to be telling her to take care. We are both professors in a department of infectious disease epidemiology, and we were worried.\nTwo months on, that anxiety has not gone,\nalthough it\u2019s also been joined by a sense of sadness. It\u2019s now clear that so many people have died, and so many more are desperately ill, simply because our politicians \n. Scientists like us said lock down earlier; we said test, trace, isolate. But they decided they knew better.\nAm I being unfair? The government assures us that its decisions and timing are based on science, as if it is a neutral, value-free process resulting in a specific set of instructions. In reality, the \n is in its infancy and developing daily, with researchers across the world trying to understand how the virus spreads, how the body responds \u2013 and how to treat it and control it. The speed at which our knowledge has increased is impressive, from the \n in January through to having \n in early February.\n are being refined to predict the extent and speed of spread and estimate the impact of control methods. My own group is studying the response of communities, showing how the epidemic is amplifying existing \n. People with the lowest household income are far less likely, but no less willing, to be able to work from home or to self-isolate.\nBut while scientists carry out observations and experiments, testing, iterating and discovering new knowledge, it is the role of policymakers to act on the best available evidence. In the context of a rapidly growing threat, that means listening to experts with experience of responding to previous epidemics.\nWhen I say that politicians \u201crefused to listen\u201d, I am referring to the advice and recommendations coming from the World Health Organization, from China and from Italy. The WHO advice, based on decades of experience and widely accepted by public health leaders and scientists around the world was clear \u2013 use every possible tool to suppress transmission. That meant testing and isolating cases, tracing and quarantining contacts, and ramping up hygiene efforts.\nThe UK did well in the early phase, but then, on 12 March, the government alarmed many public health experts by abruptly abandoning containment and announcing that community case-finding and \n. The aim was no longer to stop people getting it, but to slow it down while protecting the vulnerable.\nThe evidence underpinning the government\u2019s decision appears in a report from 9 March summarising the \n. The report did not consider the impact of case-finding and contact-tracing, but it did suggest that the biggest impact on cases and deaths would come from social distancing and the protection of vulnerable groups.\nAnd yet social distancing was not recommended then. That day, 12 March, after hearing with disbelief the \n that didn\u2019t include widespread social distancing, I recommended to my team at Imperial that they should work from home for the foreseeable future. Indeed, I have not been to my office since.\nNeither the advice nor the science were followed that week. My colleagues, led by Neil Ferguson, \n on 16 March estimating that without strong suppression, 250,000 people could die in the UK. The government responded that day with a recommendation for social distancing, avoiding pubs and working from home if possible. But there was still no enforcement, and it was left up to individuals and employers to decide what to do. Many people were willing but unable to comply as we showed \n. It was only on 23 March that a \n and economic support was announced.\nBetween 12 and 23 March, tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of people will have been infected. Boris Johnson himself may well have been infected that week, and his \n may have been avoided if the government had shifted to remote working on 12 March. The current best estimate is that around 1% of those infected will die.\nSo where to now? Once again, public health experience, including modelling, leads to some very clear recommendations. First, find cases in the community as well as hospitals and care homes; isolate them, and trace their contacts using a combination of local public health teams and \n.\nSecond, know your epidemic. Track the epidemic nationally and locally using NHS, public health and digital surveillance to see where cases are continuing to spread. This will be essential so that we can start to lift the lockdown while shielding the population from hotspots of transmission. Build community resilience by providing local support for vulnerable people affected by the virus and the negative impact of the control measures.\nThird, ensure transmission is suppressed in hospitals, care homes and workplaces through the right protective equipment, testing, distancing and hygiene. Investigate the \n, and provide appropriate protection.\nFourth, ensure that the most vulnerable, socially and medically, are fully protected through simple access to a basic income, rights for migrants, and safety for \n.\nMany, including the Labour leader, Keir Starmer, say that now is not the time for blame. I am not looking to blame \u2013 but for scrutiny so that lessons can be learned to guide our response.

Below are three examples, including a toughie which appeared in the 2020 UK puzzle championship last month. Pencil-and-paper puzzles like Double Choco are very absorbing; hopefully they provide a stimulating and escapist activity during these days of quarantine.\nThe rules of Double Choco are as follows.\n1.Divide the grid into blocks by drawing solid lines over the grid lines.\n2.Each block must contain a pair of areas of white cells and gray cells having the same form (size and shape). One area may be a rotated or mirrored image of the other.\n3.A number indicates the number of cells of that colour in the block (half the total number for the block). A block can contain any number of cells with numbers.\nThe puzzles now follow. If you want to have them all on a single printable page, \n Otherwise, you can solve them on screen with an app like Markup.\nNow for the tutorial puzzle (printed at the very top, and just below). My way in was to look at the 3 in the top left cell. This 3 tells you that there must be three white cells, and three grey cells, in that block. The only possible white cells are the three top ones in the leftmost column, since the white cells must form a contiguous area. The three grey cells must have the same shape as the white cells, in other words they must be in a line. There is only one possible position for a line of three grey cells that touches the white cells (and thus makes a single block.) I\u2019ve marked it below.\nLikewise, the 3 in the top right corner means that the grey area must consist of three adjacent grey cells. There is only one possible position for those grey cells, and also only one possible position for three white cells that share the same shape (three in a row). I\u2019ve marked that block too.\nThe white area at the bottom left has two 3s in it. At first you might think they refer to two different blocks. They actually refer to the same block. (It is fine for the same block to have more than one cell with a number in it.) It has to be the same block, since the white area of this block has three cells in it, and there are only three possible cells, the ones I have shaded orange. The area of the block covered by grey cells must have the same shape, and thus must either be cells ABD, or cells BCD.\nLet\u2019s assume it is BCD. Then where is the block that contains the remaining 3 on the white cell in the second bottom row? It cannot exist, since there are no three contiguous grey squares left on the board for that block. Hence The block with the three white squares on the bottom left contains ABD. The rest falls into place. Note that one of the blocks has no number-cells.\nDouble Choco was invented by Japan\u2019s legendary Nikoli magazine, which over the last 40 years has introduced many puzzles to a wide audience, most famously Sudoku and Kakuro.\nLast month, Double Choco was one of the featured problems at the UK Puzzle Association\u2019s annual open tournament, which took place at a Croydon hotel, and consists of a sudoku competition and a general puzzle competition.\nThe competitions are a bit like an exam: the contestants are presented with a series of papers, with each puzzle graded by difficulty. The hard Double Choco above was one of the hardest puzzles this year.\nThis year\u2019s results for the puzzle event were: 1st Neil Zussman, 2nd Vincent Bertrand, 3rd Tom Collyer. (Neil is in a league of his own in the UK and ranks amongst the best puzzle solvers in the world.) For the Sudoku event: 1st Vincent Bertrand, 2nd Tom Collyer, 3rd Mark Goodliffe.\nI\u2019ll be back at 5pm with the solutions.\nIf you like this type of pencil-and-paper puzzle, in which you need to fill in a grid following a short list of simple rules, here are some other ones I have featured in this column. They all link to printable pages. Print them all out and no chance you are leaving the house today.\n (Oct 2017)\n (Jan 2018)\n (July 2018)\n(May 2019)\nHave fun, and keep safe.\n.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/apr/06/can-you-solve-it-double-chocolate", "title": "Can you solve it?

So, there will be at most seven games. The piece of insight that makes the solution \u2018simple\u2019 is the realisation that deciding to play all seven games (regardless of outcomes) makes no difference to the issue of which team wins the series, and thus, since 4 of those 7 are home games for Team B, Team B has the advantage.\nThe paradox is this: if you just play until one team has won four games, the average number of games played is less than 6, therefore most games actually played will be at the home of Team A.\nIn other words, if the league statistician looks back over a great many years of the series, she will discover that Team A won most of the games, but Team B won most of the series!\n(The tricky part is to compute correctly that if you play until one team has won four games, that the number of games us less than six. The workings are shown below)\nPeter Winkler writes: \u201cHow can it be that home-field advantage for the seventh game, which is usually not played, is as good as home-field advantage for the first game, which is always played?\n\u201cThe answer is that something that is there when you need it is just as good as something that is there all the time. Home-field advantage in the seventh game is there when Team B needs it; if they don\u2019t get to the seventh game, they don\u2019t need that advantage as the series has already been won or lost.\u201d\nThe calculation that shows that on average fewer than 6 games are played is a bit messy:\nIf the games were all 50-50, the probabilities that a series will last 4, 5, 6, or 7 games would be, respectively, 1/8, 1/4, 5/16 and 5/16. Thus the average number of games played is (4 x 1/8) + (5 x 1/4) + (6 x 5/16) + (7 x 5/16) = (93/16) = 5 and 13/16 = 5.8125\nand since three games are always played in Town A, on average only 2 and 13/16 are played in Town B.\nReplacing 50-50 by the appropriate 51% or 49% changes the expected\nnumber of games very slightly.\nThe probability that just four games are played is .51\n x .49 + .49\n x .51 = .12499998.\nFive games: (1 x .49) x (.51\n) + (3 x .49\n x .51\n) + (3 x .49\n x .51\n) +(1 x .49\n x .51) = .2499.\nSix games: (4 x .51\n x.49) + (12 x .51\n x .49\n) + (4 x .51 x .49\n) = 0.31252498998.\nSeven games: the remaining .31257503002.\nThis results in an average of 5.81267507002, just a bit higher than we got without the home-field bias.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/science/2020/mar/23/did-you-solve-it-meet-the-puzzle-king", "title": "Did you solve it?

For years, Google\u2019s version of the test, branded \n, has dominated, after it acquired the company that developed it in 2009 and offered the technology for free worldwide.\nGoogle\u2019s introduction of charges for the service has prompted Cloudflare, a little-known firm that protects around 12% of the internet from bot attacks, to seek an alternative.\nThe company\u2019s founder and chief executive, Matthew Prince, said: \u201cIt would have added millions of dollars in annual costs just to continue to use reCaptcha for our free users. That was finally enough of an impetus for us to look for a better alternative.\u201d\nCloudflare had long been uneasy about using Google\u2019s service, Prince added. \u201cSome customers have expressed concerns. Google\u2019s business is targeting users with advertising; Cloudflare\u2019s is not. We have strict privacy commitments. We were able to get comfortable with the privacy policy around reCaptcha, but understood why some of our customers were concerned about feeding more data to \n.\u201d\nChina\u2019s block on Google was an additional concern, he said.\nCloudflare will instead use a similar service, hCaptcha, developed by Intuition Machines, a California startup. The tool has a wider range of tests than reCaptcha, including one asking users to draw a box around a specific object, or to identify the correct label for a picture.\nGoogle\u2019s reCaptcha had been free for so long because, as well as testing whether a site visitor is a robot, it uses humans to do menial tasks. The first version asked users to transcribe hard-to-read words from scanned books, while later versions used similar technology to get people to label images. This helped Google\u2019s image recognition software to tell the difference between, say, cats and dogs, and later taught the company\u2019s self-driving cars and mapping vehicles how to recognise street signage.\nThe tool was developed in part by the Guatemalan entrepreneur\n, who used a similar idea to create the first version of the language-learning app Duolingo.\nIn the past, that value exchange was enough to keep Google\u2019s tools free, but recently the company added an enterprise tier for corporate users who make more than a million calls a month, charging undisclosed fees. \u201cIn our case,\u201d says Prince, \u201cthat would have added millions of dollars in annual costs just to continue to use reCaptcha for our free users.\u201d\nUsers might not immediately welcome the replacement, however, because for all the difference behind the scenes,the tests that hCaptcha poses can be very similar to Google\u2019s. A sample on hCaptcha\u2019s website asks users to click through 9 to 27 images and select those which show a train.\n This article was amended on 17 April 2020 because, due to an editing error, an earlier version said hCaptcha was created by Cloudflare.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/16/dont-click-on-the-traffic-lights-upstart-competitor-challenges-googles-anti-bot-tool", "title": "Don't click on the traffic lights: upstart competitor challenges Google's anti-bot tool", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:57:45 GMT", "summary": "<p>New charges for reCaptcha spur web security firm Cloudflare to seek out an alternative</p><p>The days of clicking on traffic lights to prove you are not a robot could be ending after Google\u2019s decision to charge for the tool prompted one of the web\u2019s biggest infrastructure firms to ditch it for a competitor.</p><p>\u201cCaptcha\u201d \u2013 an awkward acronym for \u201ccompletely automated public Turing test to tell computers and humans apart\u201d \u2013 is used by sites to fight automated abuses of their services.

That means that if the \n goes ahead with its original plans, its app would face severe limitations on its operation.\nThe app would not work if the phone\u2019s screen was turned off or if an app other than the contact tracer was being used at the same time. It would require the screen to be active all the time, rapidly running down battery life, and would leave users\u2019 personal data at risk if their phone was lost or stolen while the app was in use.\nA spokesperson for NHSX \u2013 the the health service\u2019s digital transformation arm \u2013 denied claims of a \u201cstandoff\u201d, saying: \u201cThis suggestion is completely wrong. Everyone is in agreement that user privacy is paramount, and while our app is not dependent on the changes they are making, we believe they will be helpful and complementary.\u201d\nThe limitations mirror problems faced by Singapore, which released its contact-tracing app, TraceTogether, before Apple and Google announced their policies. The app, which has a three-star rating on Singapore\u2019s App Store, has been installed by just 12% of the population.\n\u201cThe important thing here is, if you want your iPhones to work with this in your country, then you\u2019ll need to effectively adhere to Apple\u2019s standard of privacy for the system,\u201d said Dr Michael Veale, a lecturer in digital rights and regulation at UCL.\n\u201cApple have said that the standard of privacy that they are demanding is a decentralised system. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to get iPhones to work with it without a workaround that will just stop people using it.\u201d\nThe limits exist because modern smartphones tightly control what apps can do with technologies such as Bluetooth, in order to prevent infringements of privacy. On iPhones, for example, a normal app has strictly limited access to Bluetooth unless it is running in the \u201cforeground\u201d \u2013 meaning actively on screen and in use \u2013 in order to prevent apps from surreptitiously tracking users without consent.\nThe NHS had been hoping those limits would be lifted for Covid-19 contact-tracing apps, according to a source with knowledge of the app development.\nOn Friday in a joint announcement, Apple and Google announced their intention to do that, introducing a new set of tools that public health authorities could use from May to build apps that can perform contact tracing in the background.\nBut the new tools, which come in the form of an API that lets developers code apps with special access to Bluetooth, strictly limit the information that public health authorities can gather. Most importantly, a public health authority cannot ask a phone to gather a list of every other phone it has been in contact with.\nInstead, it can only perform a much more limited version of contact tracing, which involves sending every phone in the system a list of other phones that have been reported as contagious, and asking them, in effect, \u201chave you seen this phone?\u201d said Veale.\nThe limits will prevent the NHS from obtaining useful information about population flows in the aggregate, tracking \u201cnear misses\u201d or receiving information about contacts from people who have opted into the system but not recently checked their phones.\nOn a press call to journalists on Tuesday evening, Google said those limits were in place because neither company wanted to provide functionality in their operating systems to allow for surveillance efforts that could be abused.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/16/nhs-in-standoff-with-apple-and-google-over-coronavirus-tracing", "title": "NHS in standoff with Apple and Google over coronavirus tracing", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 13:35:34 GMT", "summary": "<p>Tech firms place limitations on how tracing apps may work in effort to protect users\u2019 privacy</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>The NHS is in a standoff with Apple and Google after the two tech firms refused to support the UK\u2019s plans to build an app that alerts users when they have been in contact with someone with coronavirus.</p><p>Apple and Google are encouraging health services worldwide to build contact-tracing apps that operate in a decentralised way, allowing individuals to know when they\u2019ve been in contact with an infected person but preventing governments from using that data to build a picture of population movements in aggregate.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/16/nhs-in-standoff-with-apple-and-google-over-coronavirus-tracing\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5a6906d7713cff4fde24253c63abc45c8043c89a/670_358_2049_1229/master/2049.jpg?width=445&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=0c70f0be4806b8e8dfb46537237b56b0"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/16/coronavirus-facebook-misinformation-warning": {"story": " will begin showing notifications to users who have interacted with posts that contain \u201charmful\u201d coronavirus misinformation, the company announced on Thursday, in an aggressive new move to address the spread of false information about Covid-19.\nThe new policy applies only to misinformation that Facebook considers likely to contribute to \u201c\n\u201d, such as false claims about \u201ccures\u201d or statements that physical distancing is not effective.

Many thinkers have expressed hope that it will usher in a more humane economic system; others warn that the pandemic heralds a darker future of techno-totalitarian \n.\nThe dated cliches from the pages of 1984 are no longer a reliable guide to \n. And today\u2019s capitalism is stronger \u2013 and weirder \u2013 than its critics imagine. Not only do its numerous problems present new avenues for profit-making, they also boost its legitimacy \u2013 since the only salvation will be dispensed by the likes of Bill Gates and Elon Musk. The worse its crises, the stronger its defences: this is definitely not how capitalism ends.\nHowever, the critics of capitalism are right to see Covid-19 as a vindication of their warnings. It has revealed the bankruptcy of neoliberal dogmas of privatisation and deregulation \u2013 showing what happens when hospitals are run for profit and \n. But capitalism does not survive by neoliberalism alone: the latter merely plays the role of the bad cop, insisting, in the words of Margaret Thatcher\u2019s famous dictum, that \u201cthere is no alternative\u201d.\nThe good cop in this drama is the ideology of \u201c\n\u201d, which has transcended its origins in Silicon Valley and now shapes the thinking of our ruling elites. In its simplest form, it holds that because there is no alternative (or time or funding), the best we can do is to apply digital plasters to the damage. Solutionists deploy technology to avoid politics; they advocate \u201cpost-ideological\u201d measures that keep the wheels of global capitalism turning.\nAfter decades of neoliberal policy, solutionism has become the default response to so many political problems. Why would a government invest in rebuilding crumbling public transport systems, for example, when it could simply use big data to craft personalised incentives for passengers to discourage journeys at peak times? As the architect of one such programme in Chicago said a few years ago, \u201cSupply-side solutions [like] building more transit lines \u2026 are quite expensive.\u201d Instead, \u201cWhat we\u2019re doing is looking at ways that data can manage the demand side ... by helping residents understand the better time to travel.\u201d\nThe two ideologies have an intimate relationship. Neoliberalism aspires to reshape the world according to blueprints dating from the cold war: more competition and less solidarity, more creative destruction and less government planning, more market dependence and less welfare. The demise of communism made this task easier \u2013 but the rise of digital technology has actually presented a new obstacle.\nHow so? While big data and artificial intelligence don\u2019t naturally favour non-market activities, they do make it easier to imagine a post-neoliberal world \u2013 where production is automated and technology underpins universal healthcare and education for all: a world where abundance is shared, not appropriated.\nThis is precisely where solutionism steps in. If neoliberalism is a proactive ideology, solutionism is a reactive one: it disarms, disables and discards any political alternatives. Neoliberalism shrinks public budgets; solutionism shrinks public imagination. The solutionist mandate is to convince the public that the only legitimate use of digital technologies is to disrupt and revolutionise everything but the central institution of modern life \u2013 the market.\nThe world is currently enthralled by solutionist tech \u2013 from a Polish app that requires coronavirus patients to regularly take selfies to prove they are indoors, to China\u2019s colour-coded \n, which tracks who is allowed to leave the house. Governments have turned to companies such as Amazon and Palantir for infrastructure and data modelling, while Google and Apple have joined forces to enable \u201cprivacy-preserving\u201d data-tracing solutions. And once countries enter the recovery phase, the tech industry will gladly lend its technocratic expertise to the clean-up. Italy has already put \n, the former CEO of Vodafone, in charge of leading its post-crisis task force.\nIn fact, we can see two distinct strands of solutionism in government responses to the pandemic. \u201cProgressive solutionists\u201d believe that timely, app-based exposure to the right information could make people behave in the public interest. This is the logic of \u201c\n\u201d, which shaped the UK\u2019s disastrous initial response to the crisis. \u201cPunitive solutionists\u201d, by contrast, want to use digital capitalism\u2019s vast surveillance infrastructure to curb our daily activities and punish any transgressions.\nWe have now spent a month debating how these technologies might threaten our privacy \u2013 but that is not the greatest danger to our democracies. The real risk is that this crisis will entrench the solutionist toolkit as the default option for addressing all other existential problems \u2013 from inequality to climate change. After all, it is much easier to deploy solutionist tech to influence individual behaviour than it is to ask difficult political questions about the root causes of these crises.\nBut the solutionist responses to this disaster will only hasten the diminishment of our public imagination \u2013 and make it more difficult to imagine a world without the tech giants dominating our social and political infrastructure.\nWe are all solutionists now. When our lives are at stake, abstract promises of political emancipation are less reassuring than the promise of an app that tells you when it\u2019s safe to leave your house. The real question is whether we will still be solutionists tomorrow.\nSolutionism and neoliberalism are so resilient not because their underlying ideas are so good but because those ideas have profoundly reshaped institutions, including governments. The worst is still to come: the pandemic will supercharge the solutionist state, as \n, creating an excuse to fill the political vacuum with anti-democratic practices, this time in the name of innovation rather than just security.\nOne function of the solutionist state is to discourage software developers, hackers and aspiring entrepreneurs from experimenting with alternative forms of social organisation. That the future belongs to start-ups is not a fact of nature but a policy outcome. As a result, more subversive tech-driven endeavours that could boost non-market, solidarity-based economies die off at the prototype stage. There\u2019s a reason why we haven\u2019t seen another Wikipedia in two decades now.\nA \u201cpost-solutionist\u201d politics should begin by smashing the artificial binary between the agile start-up and the inefficient government that limits our political horizons today. Our question should not be which ideology \u2013 social democracy or neoliberalism \u2013 can harness and tame the forces of competition better, but rather: what institutions do we need to harness the new forms of social coordination and innovation afforded by digital technologies?\nToday\u2019s debate on the right technological response to Covid-19 feels so stifled precisely because no such post-solutionist politics is in sight. It revolves around the trade-offs between privacy and public health on the one hand, and around the need to promote innovation by start-ups on the other. Why are there no other options? Isn\u2019t it because we have let digital platforms and telecom operators treat our entire digital universe as their fiefdom?\nThey run it with just one goal in mind: keep the micro-targeting going, and micro-payments flowing. As a result, little thought has gone into building digital technologies that would produce macro-level anonymous insights about collective behaviour of non-consumers. The digital platforms of today are the sites of individualised consumption, not of mutual assistance and solidarity.\nWhile they can be used for non-market purposes, today\u2019s digital platforms make a poor foundation for a political order open to actors other than consumers, start-ups and entrepreneurs. Without reclaiming digital platforms for a more vibrant democratic life, we will be condemned for decades to come to the unhappy choice between \u201cprogressive\u201d and \u201cpunitive\u201d solutionisms.\nAnd our democracy will suffer as a result. The feast of solutionism unleashed by Covid-19 reveals the extreme dependence of the actually existing democracies on the undemocratic exercise of private power by technology platforms. Our first order of business should be to chart a post-solutionist path \u2013 one that gives the public sovereignty over digital platforms.\nOtherwise, complaining about China\u2019s authoritarian but effective response to Covid-19 is not only pathetic but also hypocritical: there are many varieties of techno-authoritarianism in our future, and the neoliberal version doesn\u2019t look much more appealing than the alternative.\n Evgeny Morozov is a Guardian US columnist\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/apr/15/tech-coronavirus-surveilance-state-digital-disrupt", "title": "The tech \u2018solutions\u2019 for coronavirus take the surveillance state to the next level | Evgeny Morozov", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 14:46:26 GMT", "summary": "<p>The role of the digital revolutionaries is to disrupt everything but the central institution of modern life: the market</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>In a matter of weeks, coronavirus has <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/apr/14/great-lockdown-coronavirus-to-rival-great-depression-with-3-hit-to-global-economy-says-imf\">shuttered the global economy</a> and placed capitalism in intensive care.

In normal circumstances, liberal democracies would have to think very hard about intruding so comprehensively into their citizens\u2019 privacy.\nBut these are not normal times, and it seems likely that western governments will move to deploy smartphone tracking as a way of monitoring and controlling the pandemic. When they do there will be an explosion of (understandable) outrage from civil liberties organisations, but governments will ride roughshod over these with reassuring bromides about how such \u201cemergency\u201d measures will be rolled back once the crisis has passed.

But it doesn\u2019t have to be that way. It all depends on how we design and deploy the tracking capabilities of smartphones. And contrary to what you will hear from government and tech industry sources, there are technologies that will enable us to have the societal benefit (being able to track the virus and keep individuals and authorities informed) while minimising the intrusions on personal privacy. We just have to be smarter.\nBroadly speaking, there are \n to harnessing smartphone capabilities.

On Pinterest, the only infographics and memes to be found on topics such as \u201cCovid-19\u201d or \n are those made by internationally recognised health organisations, such as the WHO.\nIt is a stark contrast to how social media platforms have dealt with misinformation in the past.\nUS-based platforms, shaped by Silicon Valley\u2019s libertarian ethos and protected by the first amendment, have long been reluctant to take a proactive editorial role or censor speech that could be considered political.\nThey have had to be pushed, prodded, cajoled, protested, and shamed into addressing \n, \n and the harassment of \n.\nOn coronavirus, they have competed to be responsible and reliable sources of information. Yet still misinformation continues to adapt and spread, largely on social media.\n by Oxford\u2019s Reuters Institute looking at the spread of 225 false or misleading claims about coronavirus found 88% of the claims had appeared on social media platforms, compared with 9% on television or 8% in news outlets.\nNearly 30% of US adults believe Covid-19 was developed in a lab, according to a survey by \n.\nA conspiracy theory falsely linking 5G to the coronavirus pandemic has led to \n, including threats and harassment against telecom engineers and petrol bomb attacks on telephone poles.\nCarl Bergstrom, a University of Washington professor of biology who also studies and has written a book about misinformation, says the efforts of the social media companies are too little, too late.\n\u201cThey\u2019ve built this whole ecosystem that is all about engagement, allows viral spread, and hasn\u2019t ever put any currency on accuracy,\u201d he said. \u201cNow all of a sudden we have a serious global crisis, and they want to put some Band-Aids on it. It\u2019s better than not acting, but praising them for doing it is like praising Philip Morris for putting filters on cigarettes.\u201d\nSome of the more radical steps taken by tech companies include Twitter\u2019s \n to remove misinformation that contradicts official public health advice, such as tweets encouraging people not to follow physical distancing guidelines, and WhatsApp\u2019s \n on message forwarding.\nThe platforms feel they can be much more aggressive on coronavirus misinformation than they have been on political misinformation, said Claire Wardle of the non-profit organisation First Draft.\n\u201cThere are no two sides with coronavirus, so they don\u2019t have people on the other side saying: \u2018We want this,\u2019 the way you do with anti-vaxxers or political misinformation,\u201d said Wardle. \u201cThey are freer to act.\u201d\nIt is also relatively simple and straightforward for the platforms to select trusted sources of authoritative information \u2013 the WHO, NHS, CDC, etc \u2013 without appearing politically biased.\nWardle faulted the tech companies for not being better prepared for the crisis, however. Facebook has long ignored the conspiracy communities that organise using Facebook groups, such as anti-vaxxers, followers of \n, and people who believe 5G is harmful. Coronavirus misinformation is rampant in those communities.\n\u201cThe sad thing is to see those kinds of conspiracies moving to neighbourhood groups, and family groups,\u201d said Wardle. \u201cIt\u2019s like sparks are flying off the bigger [conspiracy] groups and moving into other groups. Everyone is so frightened right now that it\u2019s a tinderbox and these sparks are coming off and catching fire.\u201d\nAnd while the scientific nature of the crisis may lessen some of the external political pressures over how to moderate speech, it also brings with it a slew of challenges. The coronavirus is brand new, and the scientific understanding of it changes daily.\nBergstrom described this conundrum as an \u201cuncertainty vacuum\u201d. \u201cAny reasonable authority will not give you a straight answer\u201d to certain questions about the pandemic, \u201cnot because they\u2019re trying to mislead you, but because they don\u2019t know yet,\u201d he said. \nAnother complicating factor is that normally trustworthy sources are not providing reliable information.\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen the US government, particularly the White House, becoming a significant purveyor of misinformation around the virus,\u201d Bergstrom said.\nFacebook and Twitter have removed posts by prominent and powerful people over coronavirus misinformation, including the Brazilian president, \n, but the real test of their resolve will be whether they ever take action against misinformation by Trump.\n\u201cWe planned for years for this pandemic, but we never realised that we would be fighting a war on two fronts,\u201d said Bergstrom. \u201cOne against the pandemic, and one against all the disinformation and hate and fear that is being amped up and enflamed by political opportunists.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/tech-giants-struggle-stem-infodemic-false-coronavirus-claims", "title": "Tech giants struggle to stem 'infodemic' of false coronavirus claims", "published": "Fri, 10 Apr 2020 08:46:41 GMT", "summary": "<p>Critics say efforts are too little, too late as research reveals vast majority of false claims appear online</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/series/coronavirus-live/latest\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p><strong> </strong></p><p>Click over to Google, type in \u201ccoronavirus\u201d, and press enter.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/10/tech-giants-struggle-stem-infodemic-false-coronavirus-claims\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3640c2cb134a1236e456d2136a5a5d0d0621148e/0_240_6454_3873/master/6454.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=169bd77e8cc11d9ff9b6aeafc2273619"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2020/apr/07/twitter-chief-to-donate-quarter-of-his-fortune-to-coronavirus-fight": {"story": ", Twitter\u2019s chief executive, has pledged to donate $1bn (\u00a3800m) to fund coronavirus research to help \u201cdisarm this pandemic\u201d.\nDorsey, who co-founded \n in 2006 and went on to co-found payments company Square, tweeted on Tuesday that he was donating $1bn of Square shares to a charitable fund, called Start Small, to \u201cfund global Covid-19 relief\u201d.\nDorsey, 43, said the donation was equivalent to about \u201c28% of my wealth\u201d.

We aren\u2019t provided masks, don\u2019t have the proper gloves, and not everything is being sanitized and cleaned before it comes to use,\u201d said one \n warehouse associate in Phoenix, Arizona.\nOther workers the Guardian spoke to at facilities where there had been at least one positive Covid-19 case said they were not being closed for deep cleaning, and that physical distancing was failing as hundreds could be working in the same building during a shift. Several also said that the firm was delaying sharing news that workers had tested positive.\n in the US have confirmed one or more employees have tested positive for coronavirus, as its network of facilities, which are operated by about 400,000 workers, remain open as online orders surge. Workers at Amazon warehouses in \n, \n and \n have held walkouts in protest of working conditions during the pandemic.\nThe firm insists safety is paramount, and that its benefits changes during the crisis include an additional $2 an hour, double time for overtime and two weeks of paid time off for regular part-time and seasonal employees who test positive. Workers can also take unlimited unpaid time off, though some of those who spoke to the Guardian said this was not a choice they could make financially.\nOne warehouse worker in Opa-Locka, Florida, who tested positive for coronavirus in late March said: \u201cI remember I was scared to go to work before all this started, but I had to go because Amazon never closed the building and I had to pay my bills.\n\u201cWhen I felt the first symptoms, I went to get tested, I tested positive, and I am almost sure I got it at Amazon because they are not offering at least face masks for employees to work safely,\u201d said the worker, who requested to remain anonymous. The worker said the warehouse should have closed in response to the pandemic.\nBarbara Chandler, a process assistant at Amazon JFK8 in Staten Island, New York, for more than two years, received her positive test result for coronavirus on 25 March, and was put on paid leave. She believes she contracted it from the warehouse, as she had not been going anywhere else. \u201cThey are doing temp checks which doesn\u2019t help because I never had a temperature,\u201d said Chandler. \u201cThey don\u2019t have enough workers to clean the building. Instead they called mandatory overtime for two weeks.\u201d\nShe added: \u201cThe 6ft rule isn\u2019t really being followed. You can\u2019t really follow it when you have a group of people going to break, lunch and all clocking out at the same time.\u201d\nIn Robbinsville, New Jersey, workers say Amazon delayed informing workers that employees at the warehouse had tested positive for coronavirus. \u201cThey took a whole week to let us know the first person was diagnosed, which was March 23,\u201d said one worker at EWR4 in Robbinsville. \u201cThey lie by saying they\u2019re just shipping out essential products like toilet paper, wipes and other essential items because I\u2019m still packing non-essential items like dildos, comics, video game headsets, Apple AirPods, Beats headphones, to name a few.\u201d\nThe worker also said they haven\u2019t been provided any masks and have run out of hand sanitizer and wipes. \u201cThey\u2019re now doing temperature checks at the door and still want to practice social distancing with a couple thousand people in the building. But they\u2019re hiring a mass of new employees so it\u2019s damn near impossible to stay 6ft from another individual,\u201d the worker added.\nIn Orlando, Florida, an Amazon warehouse worker at MCO1 said workers were just notified on 2 April of two \n who reportedly were last on site on 16 March. They are concerned there are other cases in the building, especially with the number of new hires Amazon is making.\n\u201cHundreds of us are still working and they just hired a lot more. We have been training new people for the past two weeks and we have more people coming in this week and next,\u201d said the worker. \u201cThe building runs 24 hours a day. We have people working day shifts and night shifts, meanwhile the virus \n, putting all of us at risk who come in contact with boxes or plastic wrap.\u201d\nThe worker said daily temperature checks have begun, and workers who have over 100F temperatures will be sent home for 72 hours, but noted workers will not be paid if they are sent home with fevers.\nAmazon\u2019s ABE4 warehouse in Easton, Pennsylvania, has \n have been diagnosed with coronavirus.

Of course, anyone with bills to pay will have to go back in eventually.\n\u201cThe fact that we\u2019re still expected to report to work in a compromised warehouse to ship non-essential products if we still want to earn our living tells me that Amazon and Jeff Bezos clearly value profits above employee safety or health.\u201d\nAnother worker at Amazon ABE4 warehouse in Easton, Pennsylvania said they are awaiting their test results from 2 April after they experienced symptoms. \u201cI only left my house for work,\u201d said the Amazon associate. \u201cWe have a lot of people quarantined, waiting on test confirmations.\u201d The worker helped start an online \n to demand the warehouse gets shut down for cleaning.\nAmazon denied claims from workers that sanitary supplies aren\u2019t provided to all workers, and that disinfectant wipes and hand sanitizer are standard across their network. \u201cNothing is more important than the safety of our teams\u2026 We are encouraging those who are unwell to stay home and taking extreme measures to keep people safe in our buildings,\u201d said an Amazon spokesperson. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to monitor the situation in our facilities, and we are taking proactive measures to protect employees and associates who have been in contact with anyone who has been diagnosed or becomes ill.\u201d\nAt New York City\u2019s JFK8 warehouse, Amazon fired manager Chris Smalls, who worked for the company for five years, after he organized a walkout protest on 31 March over a lack of protective gear and hazard pay for workers.

It\u2019s our soul that brings the magic \u2026 It\u2019s our place that makes you money.\u201d\nThe man in the video is pulsating with anger at Airbnb\u2019s decision to allow guests to cancel bookings for trips starting before 31 May with a full refund due to the coronavirus outbreak. The anger is so raw many commentators have dismissed it as a parody, and the Guardian was unable to confirm its authenticity.\nBut Airbnb\u2019s army of 700,000 hosts are distraught at the income they are losing as a result of the company\u2019s generosity to guests. \n and said the company would spend $250m (\u00a3200m) covering 25% of what hosts would have been paid under their cancellation policies for reservations between 14 March and 31 May.\nAn additional $10m relief fund is being made available to \u201csuper hosts\u201d offering grants of up to $5,000 for \u201chosts who hurt the most\u201d. Airbnb founders will also take no salary for six months, and top executives will have their salaries halved.\n\u201cAlthough it may not have felt like it, we are partners,\u201d Chesky \n. \u201cWhen your business suffers, our business suffers. We know that right now many of you are struggling, and what you need are actions from us to help, not just words.\u201d\nAirbnb has built up reported cash reserves of $3bn from \n. It collected revenues from the fees in excess of $4.8bn last year, according to Reuters. Hosts are charged 3% of every booking, while guests are charged up to 14.2%.\nThe hangover from the coronavirus pandemic is likely to last far longer than 31 May or whenever governments lift movement restrictions. Hosts report empty booking calendars stretching throughout the summer, and research by analysis website AirDNA shows bookings in some cities has fallen by as much as 96%.\nFor hosts who occasionally rent out their spare room in the style of a real bed & breakfast the lost Airbnb income due the coronavirus is a frustration.\nBut, for those who have built up mini (or in some cases not-so-mini) property portfolios that rely on a constant stream of guests churning through Airbnb apartments in Bath, Barcelona or Berlin, the prospect of weeks or months without guests spells financial disaster.\nIt is also a disaster for Chesky, 38, and the large number of Airbnb\u2019s employees who hold stock options. The company was lining up for a stock market flotation this year, which some investors hoped would value the 11-year-old tech giant at up to $42bn \u2013 even though the Wall Street Journal reported the business lost nearly $320m in just the first nine months of last year.\nIn a video presentation on Thursday, Chesky told staff the company had lowered its valuation to $26bn, down from $31bn when it last raised money from investors in September 2017, \n.\nAirbnb employees have long been pushing executives to press ahead with an initial public offering (IPO) because stock options granted to seasoned staff start to expire in November 2020. Those shares could be worthless if the platform is not trading on the public market.\n\u201cThey are stuffed, the IPO just can\u2019t happen,\u201d Richard Holway, chairman of analyst firm TechMarketView, said. \u201cAirbnb is in the worst of the worst situations. Unlike other tech firms, like Uber which can do deliveries instead of driving people, it can\u2019t diversify. There\u2019s nothing Airbnb can do to make money.\n\u201cEverything indicates that Airbnb income around the world has just stopped,\u201d he said. \u201cIt [coronavirus and lockdown] has exposed the Airbnb business model, and it\u2019s going to pull thousands and thousands of people down with it. People [hosts] have gone into it as an absolute business and they\u2019re in a very, very difficult situation.\u201d\nTo try and make some income from their empty properties landlords have flooded the rental market with their Airbnb flats. On Edinburgh\u2019s Princes Street, for example, there are 209 Airbnb listings on a road of just 494 homes. \n portal Rightmove said the number of new rentals coming on to the market in the week the UK lockdown started increased by 45% in London, up 55% in Brighton, 62% in Edinburgh and 78% in Bath. It\u2019s a similar story the world over with a 61% increase in Dublin and 41% in Prague.\nHolway said many hosts are reliant on Airbnb income to pay mortgages on not one but several properties, while others \u201crent flats off commercial landlords and then seek to make a profit renting it out on short lets on Airbnb \u2013 that\u2019s not going to happen now\u201d.\nSheffield based entrepreneur Alex Milburn claims to have made \u201c\u00a31,000,000 in Airbnb sales in 12 months\u201d and now markets his \u201crent to rent\u201d strategy in \n. He promises, in YouTube videos, he can teach others how to make six figure sums \u201cwith very little or none of your own money\u201d.\nOne Airbnb host rented out 881 properties in London in a single year making revenue of \u00a311.9m, according to AirDNA. The unnamed person was said to be highest-earning Airbnb landlord in the world in 2017.\n This article was amended on 4 April 2020 to make clearer that hosts will receive 25% of what would have been due to them under their cancellation policies.

Zoom followed rule No 1 in the playbook for internet companies: get big fast. The way to do that is to offer your service free \u2013 with the option of charging for superior services. At the moment Zoom offers free video conferencing for up to 100 participants, with a 40-minute time limit. If you want longer meetings, you have to pay for it. As with all such \u2018free\u2019 internet services, Zoom has had its \n \u2013 child abuse, porn and privacy violations, for example. To these has now been added a new problem of \u2018Zoombombing\u2019, where occasionally families and groups have had their discussions interrupted by trolls broadcasting pornography, Nazi propaganda and other crap.\nI write as a satisfied Zoom user \u2013 correction: customer, because I pay for the service. I prefer it to alternatives such as Skype, FaceTime and Microsoft Teams for larger conferences, partly because of the way it \u201cforegrounds\u201d the person who happens to be speaking at any moment. And it\u2019s clear that the service is a boon for people in the isolation zones of most countries at the moment, so it\u2019s adding tangible social value to our lives.\nBut some things about it need to be fixed, or at least clarified. The first of these involve Zoom\u2019s relationship with Facebook. An investigation by \n revealed that the Zoom iOS app was sending data to Facebook even if the user didn\u2019t have a Facebook account. This stemmed from a decision by Zoom to use Facebook\u2019s Software Development Kit (SDK) to provide a \u201cLogin with Facebook\u201d facility \u2013 ostensibly to make it easier for new users to sign up. This was all part of the Get Big Fast rule, no doubt, but the way Zoom handled the disclosure was not exactly reassuring. It did quickly update the app and stopped the data transfer. But then it blew the gaff on \n.\n\u201cWe were made aware on Wednesday, March 25, 2020,\u201d it wrote, \u201cthat the Facebook SDK was collecting device information unnecessary for us to provide our services.\u201d Ponder that for a moment. The level of carelessness implied by \u201cwe were made aware\u201d is staggering. As the veteran analyst \n observed in his newsletter, Zoom clearly had no idea what data Facebook was collecting. The only inference one can draw is that nobody in the company had actually \n Facebook\u2019s terms and conditions for the SDK \u2013 which say: \u201cWe can analyse your app, website, content, and data for any purpose, including commercial.\u201d Then there\u2019s the issue of security, and of encryption in particular.\n\u201cWe take security seriously and we are proud to exceed industry standards when it comes to your organisation\u2019s communications,\u201d \n. Any host of a meeting can \u201csecure a meeting with end-to-end encryption\u201d. Well, that\u2019s not quite right, at least if by \u201cend to end\u201d you mean encryption where the service provider has no way of decrypting the content (as, say, with WhatsApp or Signal). The encryption on Zoom communications at the moment \n that protects your communications with any website with \u2018https\u2019 in its URL. But the content is unencrypted while it is passing through Zoom\u2019s cloud servers.\nThere may be good reasons for this, but at the very least the company\u2019s website shouldn\u2019t be making exaggerated claims about encryption. It should privilege facts over marketing puffery.\nAnd the moral of all this? Zoom is providing a service of real value in these desperate times, but it needs to grow up. It\u2019s playing in the big league now.\n\u201dThomas Piketty takes on the ideology of inequality\u201d. An \n by Marshall Steinbaum in the \n of Thomas Piketty\u2019s massive and important new book.\nWhy the phrase \u201cgoing viral\u201d doesn\u2019t sound so good any more. \n by Lee Siegel in the \n.\n\u201cHow will the Coronavirus end?\u201d Ed Yong\u2019s \n in the \n.

Today, it is readily available on most devices except, oddly enough, smart TVs. If anything, there\u2019s a plethora of services, and I haven\u2019t tried most of them. The options include Zoom, WhatsApp, Facebook, FaceTime, Google Hangouts, Microsoft Teams, Skype and many more. Zoom is a business service but it works well and is clearly flavour of the month, with \n. Fake backgrounds are one of its winning features.\nIn this case, I recommend going with whatever you know best. You\u2019re probably going to have to do remote telephone support and the more familiar you are with a system, the easier that will be. If you can get the same equipment at both ends, even better. If you have to start from scratch, try it out with someone else and find the tricky bits before involving grandma.\nI can understand the appeal of the \n because it is designed for the job. The smart cameras and tracking are far better than you get in most home speaker-type devices. You can make video calls via WhatsApp as well as Facebook Messenger, and it has Amazon\u2019s Alexa built in. The drawbacks are that it involves using Facebook, it is expensive, and you are bound to have privacy concerns. (I assume grandma isn\u2019t using Facebook now as you\u2019d probably have tried Facebook Messenger as the most obvious option.)\nThe version that could swing it for some people is \n (\n), which doesn\u2019t have a screen. It plugs into your TV set and works with its own small remote as well as its \u201cHey Portal\u201d voice control.\nGoogle\u2019s \n (\n) is similar to the standalone Portal. It has a good 6.5 megapixel camera, a 10in screen and a voice-controlled Google Assistant, but it also comes with privacy concerns. They all do.\nFortunately, there is an alternative that I can recommend and use myself: Amazon\u2019s Alexa-powered Echo Show. At least with \n I\u2019m a paying customer, whereas Google and Facebook make most of their money from surveillance-based advertising. I think it\u2019s the lesser of three evils, but the final choice is up to you.\nThere are three Echo Show options with \n (\n), 8in (\n) and \n (\n) screens. Bigger screens are better, but the 8in version is the best value for money and, in my experience, the 5in model works well enough.\nYou set up an Alexa Show from a smartphone app and give it access to your contacts list. After that you will be able to make calls by saying \u201cAlexa, call grandma\u201d. Alexa can also call most numbers that are not in your contacts list if you spell them out (\u201cAlexa, call 0 2 0 8\u2026).\nAlexa performs many other useful functions, too. These include weather reports, playing radio stations or individual songs (if available), doing conversions (\u201cAlexa, what\u2019s 37 degrees in Fahrenheit?\u201d), answering general knowledge questions (though not nearly as well as \n Assistant), telling Dad jokes, and playing simple games. You can easily provide grandma with a list of things to say, and Amazon will email you suggestions on a regular basis.\nAlexa can read books and stories, including books from an Amazon Audible account. She can also control other home devices, such as lights, if you have any that are compatible. If you have an Amazon Prime account, an Alexa Show can play Amazon Prime videos.\nFinally, Alexa devices \u2013 like Portals and Nest Hubs \u2013 are always plugged into the mains, so grandma never has to think about recharging them.\nIf you decide to buy a tablet instead, an Amazon Fire HD is a good choice for your purposes, and the best value for money. There are two HD models with 8in (\n) and 10in (\n) screens, and a non-HD model with a \n (\n). The 8in version is \u201c\n\u201d, but I think it\u2019s worth paying more \n. This has a faster processor, a sharper 1920 x 1200-pixel screen, twice as much storage, better battery life (up to 12 hours) and a USB-C port. I\u2019d also pay the extra \u00a310 to remove the Amazon promotions.\nFire HD tablets have Alexa, so grandma would be able to use the same video calling system as with an Alexa Show. The drawbacks are that it\u2019s not as convenient as an always-on Alexa, will need charging often, and has comparatively poor speakers.\nA 5in Alexa Show works well as a bedside clock-radio alarm, and the larger versions work well as kitchen radios. With a Fire HD, you\u2019d need to add an accessory stand and an external speaker. (Amazon\u2019s \n will prop it up for \u00a339.99, but I\u2019d rather have the old \n, which converted a Fire HD 10 into an Echo Show. See below\u2026)\nThe Fire HD also has the advantage of providing tablet apps, so grandma could do her emails, browse Facebook, play games and other things. There are plenty of casual games suitable for seniors, and it\u2019s not too late for her to become addicted to Candy Crush or Bejeweled. You could also play Words With Friends with her.\nTechnically, Amazon\u2019s Fire OS is a fork of Android, but it has more than enough apps and games. The apps include \n, \n and \n.\nApple\u2019s FaceTime is a great way to make video calls. Its major drawback is that it only runs on Apple kit. If you had an iPhone or an iPad, then I expect you\u2019d already have decided to buy grandma an iPad. If I\u2019m wrong and you are an Apple user, you can buy an iPad with a 10.2in screen for \n.\nUnfortunately, if you have to buy new iPads for both ends, then approximately \u00a3700 is not a cheap solution compared with roughly \u00a3200 for two Echo Shows, or one Echo Show and your current smartphone.\nOf course, iPads can do thousands of things besides making video calls, and grandma would find many of them useful or entertaining. If grandma didn\u2019t want to use FaceTime for some reason, iPads support many other video calling systems, including \n. They also have more and better apps than Android and Amazon tablets.\nThere are a zillion Android tablets, and you can save a lot of money by buying \u201coff brand\u201d products. Nevertheless, I\u2019d go for a mainstream Samsung Galaxy Tab, one of the Huawei MediaPad range, or a Lenovo SmartTab. From what I\u2019ve seen \u2013 which isn\u2019t all of them \u2013 they are well made and they have good quality screens at reasonable prices.\nA geek could spend a long time pondering the selfie camera resolution, processor speed, storage and so on. I don\u2019t expect any of those will matter much for grandma\u2019s purposes. Just decide how much you want to spend and pick the best you can get.\nFrom the Samsung range, I\u2019d look at the 10.1in \n with Android 9 (Pie) for around \u00a3199 or less.\nFrom the Huawei range, I\u2019d go for a \n rather than a T5, because these have USB-C ports instead of microUSB. I couldn\u2019t find a 10in M5 with Android 9 instead of 8 (Oreo), though you could live with that or get \n instead.\nLenovo offers a 10.1in SmartTab tablet that \u201ctransforms to an Alexa-enabled Smart Screen when docked\u201d. The dock provides the stand and extra speakers for an all-in price of \n (M10) or \n (P10). That ticks both boxes at an affordable price, but I\u2019d still go for an Echo Show.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/26/what-is-the-best-tablet-for-video-calling-grandma", "title": "What\u2019s the best tablet for video calling grandma?", "published": "Thu, 26 Mar 2020 08:00:22 GMT", "summary": "<p>Chris needs a tablet or video-calling device for his grandma\u2019s Covid-19 isolation.

First, will you be working at home for two weeks or four months or possibly forever? I share the view that \n.\nSecond, who is paying for homeworking equipment and services: you or your employer?\nIf you\u2019ll only be working at home for a short time, you can probably get away with not buying much new equipment or signing up to remote working services. If you\u2019re in for the long haul, try to match or preferably beat the equipment you would normally use in the office. If you can\u2019t afford a \n (\u00a31,213.71), for example, get as close to the specification as possible.\nIf you are paying for your own kit, you may want to take an economical approach. But if the company is insisting that you work from home, ask for ergonomic equipment. This often costs more, but is worth it in the long run.\nIf your company has an IT department, then it should either supply or advise you on which equipment and software to use. This may well include a \n and a two-factor authentication system, such as \n.\nOne of the IT department\u2019s jobs is to make choices for tens or even tens of thousands of employees. You may not like their choices \u2013 I usually don\u2019t \u2013 but letting everybody pick their own collaborative software, messaging app or video conferencing system doesn\u2019t work. Of course, this doesn\u2019t prevent people from setting up unofficial groups on WhatsApp or Facebook.\nThe good news is that you may end up being more productive when you don\u2019t spend hours commuting or in meetings, taking long lunches or catching up with the latest gossip.\nThe bad news is that you have to set and stick to office routines without the external pressure to turn up on time, take regular meal breaks, and keep to a reasonable sleep schedule. Every company has early birds and night owls, so their work times are likely to diverge. However, you must overlap during some agreed office hours when everyone is always available.\nSelf-discipline is why much of the advice about working from home includes things such as getting dressed for work, even though you might work just as well in your dressing gown. But if you talk to colleagues or customers over video links, you must keep up appearances. You will be judged.\nIf you will only be working at home for a short time, you won\u2019t need much in the way of extra equipment. If you have your own laptop, you will only need an external USB keyboard and mouse, and you may already have those. After that, you can think about a separate monitor, an external hard drive for backup purposes, and either a \n or a \n to connect them all together.\nLaptops have \n so you should not use them for sustained periods of work. You can solve this problem by making your laptop work like a desktop, by putting it on a commercial \n or a pile of books and plugging in an external keyboard and mouse. Your eyebrows should be roughly level with the top of the screen, so you can work without slouching.\nBuy a docking station if you can. If you plug your laptop and all the peripherals into a docking station, you only need to unplug a single cable from the laptop to be able to take it somewhere else. That makes it easy to get a change of scene by working in another room or in the garden.\nOne major problem with working on a laptop is that most domestic tables and many desks are too high. Your arms should be angled slightly downwards when you are typing, not upwards. You can solve this problem by buying an accessory \n, where the keyboard sits under the table top, or an \n, where seat height is the key dimension. However, both of those are getting into home office territory.\nOtherwise, the supreme law for working from home is \n. Make hitting Ctrl-S (for save) a reflex action. Save files to your local hard drive and to an online drive (OneDrive is built into Windows 10), and back them up to an external hard drive or USB thumb drive. Even if you are saving your work on a company server or in an online office suite \u2013 such as Microsoft, Google or Zoho \u2013 you may need a local copy if your comms link goes down.\nMuch the best way to work at home is to set up a proper office in a spare bedroom, junk room, attic, conservatory, garden shed or David Cameron-style \n. If you have a family, your home office should have a door with a \u201ckeep out\u201d or perhaps an \n. So many people are now making podcasts, video conferencing or appearing on live TV from home offices that studio-style \u201con air\u201d signs \u2013 even neon ones \u2013 are becoming a thing. It helps avoid the spouse/partner and/or kids wandering in, to \n.\nHaving dedicated office space means you can have a proper desk, an adjustable office chair, one or more large monitors and a desktop PC that will deliver more power than a laptop for less cost. You might even be tempted to buy a standing desk or a \u201cdesk riser\u201d such as the \n (British) or the \n. \n has these and many other models.\nFor more advice, see my recent answer: \nThat answer didn\u2019t cover video conferencing, which will be important for many people pushed out of their corporate nests. Even if it\u2019s not essential for meetings, it\u2019s useful for quick video chats with colleagues. This fosters camaraderie, especially if you start to feel lonely working on your own. It\u2019s also easy to do, thanks to software such as Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams, GoToMeeting, Google Hangouts, TeamViewer and more.\nYou will look and sound a lot better if you buy a decent webcam with 1080p (Full HD) resolution. In previous answers, I\u2019ve recommended the \n webcam with microphone. It\u2019s still a good buy at \u00a363.99, though there\u2019s a newer \n model at \u00a384.99.\nIf you won\u2019t shell out for a webcam, at least get \n. Gamers love them so there are all kinds of models available at reasonable prices. You can also use them to listen to music, thus eliminating background household and traffic noises.\nBroadband shouldn\u2019t be a problem because peak usage is in the evenings when many people are streaming movies or TV or playing games such as Fortnite. Even if everyone starts video chatting, there is easily enough capacity for home workers during the day. However, you should either have an unlimited business broadband service, like me, or a cellular backup based on \n or tethering a smartphone or whatever.\nEither way, your plan B should include an alternative device \u2013 a smartphone or tablet with a Bluetooth keyboard, or a spare laptop \u2013 and an alternative way of connecting to the office, even if it means using a hotspot while parked outside a local coffee shop. Sort out all the log-in and connection details and test it before you actually need it. You probably won\u2019t be able to do much work without an internet connection.\nAlmost every operating system supports multiple users, so set up a separate account for work. Make this account look as much like your office PC as possible, with the same wallpaper and the same icons in much the same places. That way, you won\u2019t be distracted by whatever games, social media or entertainment services you use when not working.\nUsing a separate account eliminates all your personal websites from your browsers and browser tabs. Having PornHub loaded is never a good look, even if you don\u2019t accidentally switch to it.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/19/work-at-home-coronavirus-office-self-isolating", "title": "What do I need to work from home due to coronavirus?", "published": "Thu, 19 Mar 2020 08:00:48 GMT", "summary": "<p>How best to set up a home office for the short or long term if you\u2019re self-isolating</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/mar/18/coronavirus-live-news-updates-outbreak-us-states-uk-australia-europe-eu-self-isolation-lockdown-latest-update\">Coronavirus \u2013 latest updates</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/coronavirus-outbreak\">See all our latest coronavirus coverage</a></li></ul><p>What do I need to work at home during the coronavirus outbreak?

Other things being equal, a key factor is the size of the image, just as it is with still photographs. You can also reduce the file size by arbitrarily reducing the data rate or, for preference, by using a more efficient video compression system. The current favourite is \n, which is usually called MP4 for short. Technically, MP4 is the file container while H.264 is the codec that codes and decodes the video.\nThere are some good reasons for reducing video file sizes. For example, you might want to customise a high-resolution video for a low-resolution screen. You might also want to fit several videos on a device with limited storage, such as a smartphone or tablet, or an optical disc such as a CD-Rom or DVD. You might want to send the video to someone else; reducing the file size will reduce the upload and download times.\nIn general, however, it\u2019s a bad idea to reduce the size of irreplaceable videos just to save space. Disk drives are cheap, and a \n can hold thousands of videos. You can also use cheap or free online storage at sites such as \n, \n, \n and \n.\nScreen resolutions keep increasing, and 640 x 480-pixel VGA videos that used to fill a screen now look tiny on today\u2019s 3840 x 2160-pixel 4K screens. So, always shoot at the highest resolution that\u2019s practical, and keep it. In the long run, you will need every pixel you can get.\nBefore we get to the details, a warning: never edit an original video file. Always keep external backups of original files, and always work with copies. Of course, this also applies to personal photos and audio files. However, losing a 2GB video of your holiday or a kid\u2019s birthday party will hurt more than losing the odd photo.\nA standard computer screen with a resolution of 1280 x 1024 shows 1,310,720 pixels, which is 1.25MB. Your Samsung Galaxy S10 can shoot videos at an even higher resolution of 3840 x 2160 pixels or UHD (ultra-high definition), where a full screen image needs 8,294,400 pixels or 7.9MB \u2013 more than six times as much. Even with compression, 30 frames per second adds up.\nIf you wanted to customise the video for a Windows laptop with a screen resolution of 1366 x 768 pixels (1MB per screen), you could make it much smaller.\nTo get some real numbers, I downloaded 4K Sample2.mp4 from \n, which offers a few free mp4 video files for testing or demo purposes. If you just want to look at it, it\u2019s also on \n. It has been shot from a drone so perhaps not a phone, but either way, this 63-second video takes up 165MB.\nReducing the resolution from 3840 x 2160 pixels (UHD) to 1280 x 720 (HD) cut the file size from 165MB to 24MB, so I could almost fit seven videos into the space previously occupied by one. And while it no longer filled my 4K screen, it still looked good quality to me.\nI used WonderFox\u2019s free \n, which reduced the video to 24MB in less than 20 seconds. \n reduced it to 21.3MB but worked the processor harder and took a minute longer. \n reduced it to 7.6MB with a noticeable loss of visual quality. There are \n that will do this job, so it\u2019s just a question of finding one you like.\nPro tip: Handbrake can convert a smartphone\u2019s variable frame rate videos to a constant frame rate for editing. (It stops the sound going out of sync.)\nWhen reducing video resolutions, it is very important to keep the same aspect ratio (width to height). If you don\u2019t, clocks will no longer look round and faces will be distorted so they are either squashed or elongated like a \n.\nHere\u2019s a guide to the most common resolutions for people who can\u2019t divide 1024 by 576 in their heads.\nToday\u2019s most popular video format has a 16:9 aspect ratio, which is widescreen. This covers HD (1280 x 720), Full HD (1920 x 1080) and UHD (3840 x 2160). You can also use 1024 x 576, 1600 x 900, 2560 x 1440 and other resolutions while keeping the aspect ratio the same.\nYesterday\u2019s most popular format had a 4:3 aspect ratio, which used to be the standard for TV sets and early monitors. You can convert these videos to and from 640 x 480 (VGA), 800 x 600 (SVGA), 960 x 720, 1024 x 768 (XGA), 1440 x 1080, 1600 x 1200 (UXGA) and 2048 x 1536.\nIf you have a video with an odd aspect ratio, such as 16:10, then reprocess it to a popular widescreen width while keeping the height in proportion.\nWhen you reduce the resolution of a video, it fills a smaller area, so you don\u2019t need to send the screen as much data. However, in some video editors, you can set the data rate to almost anything you like. This will reduce the image quality as well as the file size.\nMany people don\u2019t perceive or don\u2019t care about the difference in sound quality between mp3 music files at 128kbps instead of 256kbps or 320kbps. Similarly, many don\u2019t care if their videos run at 2-3Mbps instead of 20Mbps or more. In fact, movie-streaming websites may reduce the data rate from 10-20Mbps to 2-3Mbps because it saves a huge amount of bandwidth.\nWhen I converted the 4K sample above, HDVCF automatically reduced the original bit-rate of 21,722kbps to 3,346kbs, which is reasonable for the size. Any Video Converter reduced it to 996kbps, which was too much. I should have changed the quality setting from normal to high.\nAlternatively, I could have retained the original resolution and reduced the data rate to a not-too-shabby 8,000kbps. Doing this in HDVCF reduced the file size from 165MB to 61MB, with watchable results. Dropping it to 2,659kbps (I asked for 3,000) reduced the file size to 20.2MB while retaining the original resolution, but with poor results \u2013 too many \n.\nThis approach works best with static subjects. A video of a \n doesn\u2019t need as much bandwidth as an ice hockey game.\nOne of the best ways to reduce the size of a file is to change the way it\u2019s compressed. Today\u2019s leading codecs, mainly H.264, are much more efficient than the ones typically used in old mpg, wmv (Windows Media Video) and avi files. Video transcoding programs usually take it for granted that you\u2019ll want to convert any old video into some form of MP4/H.264/AVC.\nThe catch, of course, is that your processor has to do a lot more work to decode the higher level of compression. Happily, processors are more powerful than they used to be, and Intel got round the problem by building H.264 decoding into the CPU, under the Quick Sync Video label. A year later, in 2012, AMD followed with VCE, its own Video Coding Engine.\nYour Samsung phone uses MP4 as standard, but the settings let you turn on \u201chigh-efficiency video\u201d and \u201crecord videos in HEVC format to save space\u201d. Samsung warns: \u201cYou may not be able to play HEVC videos on other devices or share them online.\u201d\nUsing HEVC would reduce the size of your videos, but I probably wouldn\u2019t do it.\n is shorthand for H.265, which should have been a shoo-in to replace H.264, H.263, H.262 and so on. Unfortunately, it is heavily \u201cpatent encumbered\u201d \u2013 and Samsung seems to own far more of the patents (4,249) that anyone else.\nAlong with the patents and patent sharing pools, H.265 brings a dramatic increase in royalties over H.264, plus the threat of content distribution fees. A breakaway group has therefore formed an \n to create a royalty-free alternative called AV1.\nNormally, this wouldn\u2019t amount to a hill of beans. In this case, the alliance includes Amazon, Netflix, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Intel, Arm, AMD, Nvidia, Cisco and \u2026 Samsung!\nAll bets are off until AV1 appears.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/mar/05/how-do-i-shrink-the-size-of-my-phone-videos", "title": "How do I shrink the size of my phone videos?", "published": "Thu, 05 Mar 2020 08:00:02 GMT", "summary": "<p>Yanis\u2019s Samsung Galaxy S10 shoots high-quality videos but they take up too much space </p><p>How can I compress videos so I don\u2019t lose a lot of the quality?

We\u2019ve also \n to make Google LLC the data controller responsible for your information and for complying with applicable privacy laws.\u201d\nThis makes sense. There is no reason why two countries that are not in the EU should store data in an EU country. It would be much better, of course, if \n stored UK data in the UK. However, now we are just one of dozens of small countries, it may be hard to justify the cost.\nOther online service providers may well make the same decision, after weighing the financial, commercial and legal costs of storing UK users\u2019 data locally.\nAt the moment, it should be a moot point. UK data is covered by the Data Protection Act 2018, which is the UK\u2019s version of the EU\u2019s GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). One problem is that the UK may \n, along with our food and other standards, as part of a US trade deal. Another problem is that even if we maintain EU-level regulations, there is no guarantee that the US will observe them. Given Trump\u2019s actions since taking the US presidency, it is hard to imagine that the situation has improved since \n shocked us with his revelations.\nIt is hard to be sure where your data is stored because service providers can and do rent space in other people\u2019s hyperscale data centres. However, as far as I know, only Amazon (AWS) and Microsoft have their own server farms in the UK. Google\u2019s are in Dublin, Belgium, Denmark and Finland. Facebook\u2019s are in Dublin and Denmark. Microsoft has a site in Dublin, of course, but it also has data centres in London, Durham and Cardiff.\nAs traffic grows, the major online service providers keep opening new data centres to be closer to their customers. However, outside the US and the EU, coverage can be sparse. \n, for example, has only three data centres \u2013 in Chile, Singapore and Taiwan \u2013 south of New Orleans. It doesn\u2019t have any in Africa, or in Brazil, China, India, Russia or Japan.\nAt the moment, Microsoft is the only major service provider to host UK data in the UK. Presumably, this is a commercial decision based on selling Office 365 and Azure cloud services to the British government and businesses that actually care where their data is stored. However, some less popular Office services are served from overseas. Yammer, Planner and Forms, for example, are still served from \n.\nConsumers who use Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com webmail do not have any control over where their data is stored. As a matter of principle, Microsoft stores it for best performance. Local storage is therefore the most likely option but that could depend on network speeds and whether there is enough local storage available.\nAgain, it should be a moot point. Microsoft has been pushing for higher data protection standards in the US, and it responded to the GDPR by \u201clevelling up\u201d. That is to say, it applies \n standards for all users in all countries, even if the local regulations allow lower standards.\nIf you are determined to switch away from Gmail, then Microsoft\u2019s Outlook.com is an option. Both services offer 15GB of free storage and both will import your old emails, which makes for an easy transition. (Microsoft also offers an extra 5GB of storage in OneDrive, which Google doesn\u2019t.) Both services let you reply from your \u201cold\u201d email address if necessary.\nHowever, getting everyone to use a new address takes time and I find Outlook.com\u2019s infinite scrolling pages and broken search/move routine a horrible experience in a browser. If you get a significant amount of email, I would only recommend it with a decent mail program such as Microsoft Outlook (the Office program), eM Client, Mailbird or whatever. Fortunately, the smartphone and Windows 10 apps, which provide a different view of your webmail, are fine.\nYou could also consider \n, the English-language version of the German email service, \n (from Global Mail eXchange). It is a free service that can send encrypted emails and it includes three somewhat primitive office apps. GMX used to have a very limited amount of storage but now offers 65GB \u2013 space for \u201cabout half a million emails\u201d, the company says. The idea is to use GMX\u2019s Mail Collector to pick up mail from your other accounts and consolidate it in one place.\nIt is a couple of decades since I last used GMX but it was very easy to open an account and it sent emails without any problems.\nI have mentioned some other alternatives \u2013 FastMail and ProtonMail \u2013 before. \n is a good, independent email service with 24/7 support at reasonable prices: $3 (\u00a32.30) per month with 2GB of storage and $5 per month with 30GB. While the company is Australian, its servers are in Amsterdam and New York, so your data should be inside the EU. Fastmail encrypts the email on its servers and it supports YubiKey access for extra security.\n is an encrypted GDPR-compliant privacy-focused email service based in Switzerland, which has high data protection standards. Its free service only offers 0.5GB of storage, which isn\u2019t viable for many users. Its Plus plan with 5GB of storage costs \u20ac5 (\u00a34.18) per month or \u20ac48 per year.\nYou cannot do anything about where \n, Twitter, WhatsApp, Instagram et al store your data. These are all proprietary services and they can do whatever they like. If you do not want them to store your data in the US, you will have to download whatever you need (if that\u2019s possible) then delete your accounts.\nThe same thing is true of most business services until they have grown big enough to start opening data centres overseas, such as Adobe.\nHowever, you do have a choice of online storage services or \u201ccloud drives\u201d, where the technologies are basically interchangeable. I covered some of these services in an earlier answer: \nIf you fancy the Swiss option, \n will store 500GB of data for \u00a347.88 per year or 2TB for \u00a395.88 per year. It will also store 2TB for a lifetime for a one-off payment of \u00a3350. The assumption is that disk space will keep getting cheaper until the cost of storing 2TB is irrelevant.\nWhen I got my first 10MB hard drive in the early 1980s, disk space cost about $500,000 per gigabyte, so 2TB would have cost a cool $1bn. Today, you can buy\n. Sobering thought.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/technology/askjack/2020/feb/27/can-i-move-my-data-to-the-eu-before-google-shifts-it-to-the-us-brexit", "title": "Can I move my data to the EU before Google shifts it to the US?", "published": "Thu, 27 Feb 2020 09:15:18 GMT", "summary": "<p>Post-Brexit, Sean wants to keep his data protected by the EU\u2019s GDPR rather than laxer US privacy laws</p><p>Given Google\u2019s recent announcement about moving UK users\u2019 data to US jurisdiction, what\u2019s the best way to migrate to EU-based services?

But these blockbuster action games tend to feature enemies \u2014not ideal if all you want is a peaceful ramble around a beautiful place.\nLuckily, there\u2019s a genre of video games called walking simulators, where the goal is simply to wander around an unknown space. Many of the best-known walking sims take place in confined indoor spaces (if you haven\u2019t already, you need to try \n, \n and\n), but there are plenty that offer broad, natural landscapes to explore (\n, \nand \n are great examples, and great worlds to wander). For some recent and unequivocally comforting virtual walks \u2013 all friendly to first-time players \u2013 try one of these.\nYou\u2019re a cute teenage bird visiting Aunt May in her seaside village. But mobile reception is nonexistent, so you hike up a mountain to try and find some. At your own pace, you can chat with neighbours, collect shiny things, and hike, swim and fly up to Hawk Peak. The in-game hiking trails make this a perfect outdoor escape from being cooped up inside.\n \nThe dappled air of Eastshade sparkles, beckoning you into villages brimming with cosy cheer. You\u2019re a traveling painter whose commissions take you to all corners of the island: windmill-covered cliffs, balloon rides to snow-capped mountaintops, ancient forest paths that lead to the beach. There\u2019s golden light, supernaturally beautiful eclipses once a day, and low-pressure tasks assigned by kind anthropomorphic creatures. Playing Eastshade feels like the loveliest respite for anyone who dreams of travelling to a faraway land to drink tea and pursue creative passions. \n \nYou\u2019re a lost soul inhabiting the body of one animal after another, traversing a post-human world long after those inhabitants have disappeared. You were once one of them. Sometimes, as you come across the shadows of your family and friends, bits of your past return to you. While the story gradually takes shape, the most fun is in gasping at the gorgeous vistas and switching perspectives from majestic wolf to darting fish to adorably rotund wombat. Each animal\u2019s capabilities show you new ways to explore the flourishing ecospheres, none of which you\u2019ll want to leave. \n \nThis new idle/adventure game is dark in tone but the poignant concept and cosy execution make it worth exploring. Far beneath the ground lives a king who plans to sleep for 400 days \u2013 real days, which will pass whether or not you\u2019re playing. In a plea all too relevant, all the king asks of you \u201cis to wait and never to leave these caves\u201d. With that, Shade, your elf-like character, begins the lonely vigil, trudging around the vast underground network to find small treasures. Time becomes a landscape and waiting your tool of exploration, as days and weeks of actual time must pass before you can continue some excursions. As it passes, Shade begins to feel like your friend, as small footsteps patter around in a background window of your computer. They could really use a friend to pass the time with \u2013 who couldn\u2019t. \n \nGo the woods and play in this contemplative adaptation of Henry David Thoreau\u2019s masterpiece.

Fortunately, if you\u2019re missing the competitive zeal of live sports, multiplayer games such as \n enable fans to create their own tournaments \u2013 providing both distraction therapy, and the chance to beat your sister to the Premier League title. Here are five recommended multiplayer sports sims, and how to set them up for fierce, sofa-based competition.\nOne of Fifa\u2019s great strengths is its options for offline tournament play. There are 63 competitions included, such as the English FA Cup and German DFB-Pokal. If you live with 19 other people you can even set up an entire Premier League season, with every club human-controlled.\nBest of all is the Custom Tournament mode, where you and three (or seven!) additional family members can go head to head, using your choice of Fifa 20\u2019s 700 teams. Flexible options include two-legged ties and the number of permitted substitutes, plus your choice of trophy and stadium for the final.\nThere\u2019s sadly no way to set up an online tournament alongside friends, although \n is a fine alternative. Here you team with a mate against similar tandems, with a system of 10 divisions ensuring you\u2019re matched to opponents of equal ability. All results count towards a global leaderboard.\nThe best choice for a living room baseball tournament that won\u2019t threaten your double glazing is The Show\u2019s excellent Home Run Derby mode. It\u2019s available for two, four or eight players, with the simple aim of scoring more homers than your opponent to progress.\nThe Show features fully licensed players from all 30 MLB clubs, and you can set tournament brackets to feature any of these. There are various time limits, but three minutes feels optimal, particularly when factoring in a cool additional feature: hit two home runs longer than 440 feet and you score a 30-second bonus.\nFor the first time since 1945, there will be \n. In real life, anyway: AO2 enables you to play out the tournament and declare your own victor. While The Championships aren\u2019t officially licensed, the game\u2019s \u201cLondon\u201d stadium and the \u201cLarge Gold 4\u201d and \u201cMedium Silver 17\u201d trophies are clearly inspired by the biggest event on the tennis calendar. \n It\u2019s slightly more complex than the other games listed here as custom tournaments require at least eight players, but there\u2019s an easy way to offset this: simply start your competition, then simulate the entire quarter-finals round. You\u2019re now set for four-way action featuring your pick of Rafael Nadal, Ga\u00ebl Monfils, Ash Barty, Johanna Konta and more.\nIf you have a few younger players in your household, Mario Tennis Aces (Nintendo Switch) is a lot of fun and allows four-player matches, and it\u2019s portable so you can take it out into the garden.\nFive years after release, EA\u2019s most recent golfing effort enjoys a cult following \u2013 to the point that secondhand copies start at \u00a370. That\u2019s purely down to its offline excellence. While PGA\u2019s lack of online options disappointed, sofa-based play is of a pass-the-pad nature that immaculately apes the series\u2019 Mega Drive roots.\nUp to four players compete over 12 courses, the pick of which is Paracel Storm: a preposterous yet brilliant 18-hole round based on Battlefield 4. Stick-swinging controls suit players of all ages, but Sega alumni can make use of a classic three-tap technique if so preferred.\nIf you have trouble getting a copy, serious players might want to try \n, which aims to be a very accurate simulation of the sport. More accessible alternatives include the long-running cartoon-style favourite \n(PS4) or the incredibly hectic \n (PC, PS4, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch), currently just \u00a32 on Switch.\nVisual Concepts\u2019s basketball veteran goes one step beyond the other games listed. In addition to setting up offline tournaments, you can create online competitions too. Up to 35 friends can join you in playing out a real NBA season with six expansion teams, or a created one that mixes classic rosters with contemporary ones.\nIf you\u2019d rather stick to home-bound b-ball, the offline Playoffs mode is the way to go: a straight knockout tournament where up to 16 players can be user-controlled. Again, set-up options are plentiful, including a fantasy draft option in case you\u2019re desperate to make Giannis Antetokounmpo a Brooklyn Net.\nGot your own favourite multiplayer sports games?

I have now played Apex Legends for over 500 hours. The online multiplayer shooter, developed by Californian studio Respawn Entertainment and released in February 2019, has been my obsession all year, seeing off a variety of pretenders from \n to \n.\nTo the casual observer, there\u2019s nothing remarkable about it. Set in a science-fiction universe tied to Respawn\u2019s successful Titanfall series, it is another title in the battle royale genre alongside the Goliath that is \n, as well as \n and Call of Duty: Warzone. You land in a hi-tech future landscape with two team-mates and then you scramble about, finding weapons, while 19 other teams try to kill you and everyone else. The last team left alive is the winner.\nBut the thing is, Respawn is one of the greatest designers of fast-paced shooter games in the industry. Formed in 2010 by the creative directors behind Call of Duty, Jason West and Vince Zampella, the studio was set up with most of the technical and design staff behind the legendary \n \u2013 and this experience shows in Apex Legends.\nOne vital element of game design that\u2019s explored perfectly is the interplay between flow and friction. Indeed, much of the time Apex Legends feels frictionless. When you move through the environment you do so freely; if you like, you can hit a button to slide, giving you a short speed boost on level ground but also allowing you to sledge extremely quickly down hills. It\u2019s quick, satisfying, and if you\u2019re sliding toward an object, you can hit the jump button to break out of the animation, gracefully avoiding a collision. The two Apex Legends maps we\u2019ve seen so far are designed to encourage and facilitate this form of traversal, with lots of slopes and valleys to explore.\nBuildings and rockfaces also keep the player moving. Whenever you approach a tall object, there is almost always a handy grip point \u2013 say, a rocky outcrop or a window ledge \u2013 a few metres higher than your character. When you jump at a vertical surface, you scramble up a little, adding extra height and putting that grip point just within reach. This scramble animation makes you feel as though you worked for it, providing a sense of achievement, even though raised platforms are almost always accessible. The game is working with you.\n\u201cIn instances where the player is not entirely sure if they can get somewhere but decide to try anyway, 90% of the time they are going to succeed,\u201d says game designer Dan Pearce, director at Four Circle, and fellow Respawn fan. \u201cEverything in Apex is balanced like this, the same way that bullets in Halo curve slightly to hit their target, or Mario has about half a second where he can still jump after running off the edge of a surface.\u201d\nAnother aspect Dan and I both like is the decision to go with three-player squads, rather than the four-person teams favoured by Fortnite or Call of Duty. It means no one can be carried \u2013 everyone has to work together and be a functional part of any strategy. \u201cThree players also means it\u2019s really easy to set up a balanced rock/paper/scissors-style team, where someone\u2019s focused on traversal, someone\u2019s focused on aggression, someone\u2019s focused on defence,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cThree players is also a small enough group that, if you were really in the zone, you could conceivably take out a whole squad single-handed.\u201d\nBut the masterstroke in terms of cooperative play is the game\u2019s ping system, which allows players to highlight areas of the map, useful items and enemy locations to their team-mates without talking. This, together with a conversation wheel offering a range of tactical phrases, means that it\u2019s possible to play as a squad with strangers without having to use your voice, which is intimidating and opens you to the possibility of abuse \u2013 or unwanted noise. \u201cIt is a genuine blessing for games culture,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cI might never again have to awkwardly describe an enemy\u2019s location over the sound of a stranger\u2019s barking dog while I\u2019m being riddled with bullets.\u201d\nHaving spent a lot of time wandering the two Apex Legends maps \u2013 King\u2019s Canyon and World\u2019s Edge \u2013 what I\u2019ve noticed is how functional the architecture and topography are; how they work together to provide fun little playgrounds, choke points and risk centres. The icy slides down to the Epicenter, the slim, lava-surrounded walkways of the Dome, the wide, densely overlooked streets of Capitol City. In a game with such extravagance in terms of weapon design and character special abilities, you need each area of the environment to provide strict and specific roles. Respawn\u2019s approach to staging is more theatrical than cinematic. \n\u201cThere\u2019s incredibly little that is extraneous in the designs,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cAlmost nothing is there just because it looks cool. Every Respawn game so far has felt to me like it could be played with blocky prototype graphics and still be just as involving, because every element justifies its inclusion mechanically. This kind of puzzle-box design, where everything clicks together in such a deliberate way, is harder to come across in games with larger scopes. Respawn isn\u2019t the only developer doing this \u2013 \n felt similar to me, but it is rare in the big-budget, triple-A space.\u201d\nBut what I really love about Apex Legends is the simple, unimpeded pleasure of moving through the world. Lots of game designers are very interested in Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi\u2019s concept of flow, a highly focused mental state in which actions become almost automatic. Assisting flow is one of the most underappreciated elements of design \u2013 it might be found in the way a game illuminates certain areas in the world to show where the player should go (\n does this brilliantly), or the use of rumble feedback to indicate the edges of a road in a racing game. But what Apex Legends does is reduce friction in a way that makes the player feel skilful.\n\u201cI think this is why Apex has found so much success, even among players who don\u2019t usually enjoy battle royale games,\u201d says Pearce. \u201cIt\u2019s very easy for players to feel overwhelmed when they\u2019re being introduced to these games, but Respawn balances everything to make the player feel about 20% more competent and cognisant than they are.\u201d\nOf course, I have to deal with the realisation that the game I\u2019ve played the most this year is the one that\u2019s designed to flatter me. But, 500 hours in, I don\u2019t really care.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/09/apex-legends-almost-perfect-shooter-game", "title": "Why Apex Legends has kept me playing for 500 hours", "published": "Thu, 09 Apr 2020 06:54:12 GMT", "summary": "<p>Striking a perfect balance between friction and flow, could this battle royale hit be the perfect shooter game?</p><p>That\u2019s it.

The two triggers will also feature adaptive feedback in the trigger buttons, so players can feel the tension and release when, say, firing an arrow from a bow.\nCertain elements, such as the DualShock 4\u2019s central touchpad, have been retained, although the light bar, which was previously on the front panel of the pad, is now on the face. A mic has also been added so that players are able to chat to friends without having to plug in a headset.

It seems the use of haptic feedback in the DualSense controller is designed to accompany the console\u2019s Tempest 3D sound engine, providing clearer, more definitive, placement of in-game audio.\nThe look of the \n itself is yet to be revealed, although the new controller suggests a likely move away from the black box design of the PS4. The machine is still slated for a winter 2020 release, similar to the Xbox Series X console from Microsoft.

This meant delaying the game until such a time where we can solve these logistic issues.\u201d\nVideo game usage has exploded during the widespread social isolation enforcement, with online gaming services often struggling to meet demand. And with about 80% of game sales now coming via digital download, according to the Entertainment Retailers Association, it had seemed that the sector was coronavirus-proof.\nHowever, blockbuster video game titles like The Last of Us II still tend to sell more copies in physical rather than digital form; often because mainstream audiences are less experienced with online purchasing, or because purchasers take advantage of pre-order offers and discounts from shops and supermarkets. The most successful game in the UK in 2018, \n, achieved 75% of its sales from the physical product rather than through digital downloads.\nWhat the delay of The Last of Us Part II shows is that the closure of stores and the disruption to the manufacturing and distribution pipeline for physical software products is still problematic for the games industry.\n\u201cThe Last of Us II, by all accounts and appearances, looks to be finished, so this is a commercial decision,\u201d said Seth Barton, editor of industry news publication \n. \u201cSony is concerned that the crisis will stymie the launch of its flagship title for the year. Bricks and mortar retail still makes up a considerable part of the sales mix, especially for the biggest titles, and with every Game Digital store in the UK and every GameStop in the US closed, launching a really big game right now is going to cost you. There\u2019s also the possibility that the crisis has delayed production and shipping of high-margin collector\u2019s editions of the game.\u201d\nAnd if The Last of Us Part II has fallen victim to the uncertainty and disruption around Covid-19, it\u2019s likely other major releases will follow. Titles such as \n and Cyberpunk 2077, which were also due for release in the next few months, may also be affected \u2013 if not by sales and manufacturing channels then by disruption to the development process itself.\n\u201cWhile big games have long been created by teams in distributed locations, having your individual staff all working from home is far from ideal,\u201d says Barton. \u201cThe process of bringing a big game to fruition is a complex one, and certain elements, such as performance capture, motion capture and [quality assurance] will be very hard to relocate out of dedicated spaces.\n\u201cQA is a particular bugbear, especially given the industry\u2019s penchant for incredible secrecy and round-the-clock shifts approaching launch. Sending test kits and code to testers\u2019 homes looks both practically difficult and potentially risky.\u201d\nGame developer Will Luton, who now runs consultancy \n, reiterates the difficulties that Covid-19 brings to games testing. \u201cFor consoles, people need access to developer test kits. Often there are fewer than needed and they are shared around in a studio, with QA departments using rolling shifts for 24-hour coverage. So getting these into the homes and set up for the right people at the right time will be a logistics challenge, especially considering that technically these kits need to be kept securely in one building.\u201d\nThis winter was also set to host two major console launches: the \n and \n. But, given the reliance on complex manufacturing and distribution channels and the need to get tens of thousands of units into both digital and physical stores, might we see Microsoft and Sony rethinking the schedule?\n\u201cThat depends on China\u2019s ability to control the virus, specifically in Shenzhen, the world\u2019s electronics factory, as there\u2019s nowhere else you can realistically move production,\u201d says Barton. \u201cIn addition, component supplies may be impacted, though the initial slowdown there generally seems to have picked back up.\u201d\nLuton also points to the security issues of having staff working from home while developing and testing PS5 and \n Series X titles. \u201cI would imagine Sony and Microsoft would be reluctant for their next-gen hardware to be in some private residence and they certainly wouldn\u2019t want to ship one there. But they\u2019ll have to change policy as the lockdown continues.\u201d\nThe one positive factor is that digital channels are there if needed.\n\u201cOptical media manufacture is going to falter as supply chain is disrupted and bricks and mortar retail has completely disappeared,\u201d says Luton. \u201cWhile people are spending more money and time on games, a big chunk of the sales channel has just disappeared. I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if some AAA games now attempt a digital-only release as some of the Hollywood blockbusters have tried with a \n approach. But it\u2019s a massive unknown.\u201d\nThere\u2019s also the fact that key titles such as The Last of Us Part II and Cyberpunk are both set to launch on current generation consoles as well as the PC \u2013 so there is a lot of hardware out there that can already play these games.\n\u201cThankfully, this is the most resilient console market we\u2019ve ever had. The new consoles could be delayed into 2021 and we\u2019d still \u2013 Covid-19 permitting \u2013 be able to play all this winter\u2019s big releases on our current hardware. It pains me to say it, but we\u2019ve never \n new hardware less.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/games/2020/apr/03/the-last-of-us-part-ii-delayed-playstation-sony", "title": "The Last of Us Part II delayed by coronavirus \u2013 is this the start of a trend?", "published": "Fri, 03 Apr 2020 11:43:27 GMT", "summary": "<p>Sony has put its PlayStation title of the year on hold indefinitely.

This was the fate of the Samoan FA in June 2008 after concerns were raised about the state of its finances. At which point Fifa fired up the corvette and sent in its platoon of tuxedoed Mr Fix-its.\nLet\u2019s be clear. Nobody wants a visit from \n Normalisation Committee. The team of high moral priests sent to the Samoan FA\u2019s door that day were handpicked by a specially convened Fifa emergency committee, a delegation that read, in no particular order: Sepp Blatter, \n, Issa Hayatou, Michel Platini, Reynald Temarii, Mohammad bin Hammam and Nicol\u00e1s Leoz.\nOr to give them their full Seven Dwarves-style nicknames: Six Year Ban Guy, Criminal Charges Guy, TV Rights Fine Guy, Dishonest Payment Guy, Eight Year Ban Guy, Life Ban Guy and of course everyone\u2019s favourite crime-fighting administrator, Interpol Red Notice Guy. Here they come, the lads: a perfumed kerchief held to their noses, here to de-corrupt your football association.\nTwelve years on the Samoa emergency committee is arguably one of the best jokes modern football has ever come up with. Just how abnormal do you have to be to require this degree of normalising? But then these were the golden years of footballing chicanery, when the yak-hide handbags flowed like wine and when \n could basically do as it wished.\nThe anomaly was that Samoa fought back. In a rare show of resistance the Samoan FA appealed to the court of arbitration for sport. It didn\u2019t work. The appeal was rejected and the good times continued to roll at Fifa house, reaching a peak with the bribe-shadowed World Cup bid decisions that would prove an act of hubris even for that thoroughly debauched regime.\nAnd so to the present day. Replace one bald, unctuous Swiss with a slightly younger bald, unctuous Swiss and something similar is happening in the Caribbean, a test case for where we may be heading in the struggle for the heart, soul and wallet of world football.\nThe \nexperienced its own visit from the Fifa Normalisers in March after another shemozzle over debt. Like Samoa the TTFA has fought back. Another appeal has been lodged at Cas, this time via crowdfunded legal action.\nFifa\u2019s move does seem bizarrely aggressive. The deposed TTFA committee had been in place for only four months, having seen off Gianni Infantino\u2019s favoured candidate David John-Williams in a local vote.\nThe TTFA board member Keith Look Loy has accused Fifa of acting like \u201ca colonial absentee landlord\u201d. The former Newcastle, West Ham and Portsmouth goalkeeper Shaka Hislop has called the intervention \u201ca coup\u201d. In an excellent twist the leader of the ousted rebel FA is even called William Wallace. They can take our lives but they\u2019ll never take \u2026 our freebies.\nMuch has been made by the \n of Look Loy and co\u2019s historic association with the disgraced Jack Warner, once of the Samoan Normalisation Committee and now avoiding the US justice system.\nAsked about rumours he might have lobbied for the Wallace campaign \u2013 something Wallace fiercely denies \u2013 Warner told the broadcaster Andre Errol Baptiste of Port of Spain-based i95.5fm: \u201cEven if that was the case, and by the way that is not the case, and it means that is the beginning of the way to lift football in the country, so be it. What\u2019s wrong with that?\u201d Which pretty much clears that one up.\nWhat is actually happening here? This might feel like a dispute at the edge of things, with plenty that is undesirable on both sides, but Fifa\u2019s actions seem extraordinarily high-handed and patrician, even by its own standards, evidence of the increasing hawkishness of the Infantino regime. As the Norwegian \n the man in charge of all this normalisation is even one of Infantino\u2019s best friends, his old university chum V\u00e9ron Mosengo-Omba\nThis matters right now. There is a great deal up for grabs a month into the total collapse of club football\u2019s broadcast rights power base. This perhaps explains why Fifa\u2019s public statements during the Covid-19 crisis have been almost alarmingly relaxed. Fifa may suspend all international football. Fifa may, we hear, dig into its \u00a32bn cash fund to bail out clubs and leagues.\n\u201cNever let a serious crisis go to waste\u201d is an overused line in the current uncertainty but you can bet Infantino has it inked on the back of his hand. Make no mistake Fifa has a great deal to gain at a time when every entity that has tried to resist its power, from Premier League to Uefa to the poor old TTFA, is significantly weakened.\nThe collapse of the Blatter-Warner-Platini era hit Fifa hard but not that hard. Money continued to flow but what Fifa really wants is power, most noticeably in its shadow-struggle with club football, where Infantino is convinced it is Fifa\u2019s destiny to take a stronger role.\nThis seemed to be coming to a head late last year as Florentino P\u00e9rez presented a breakaway plan led by the richest clubs to cut out domestic leagues, with Fifa seemingly in close, approving pursuit.\nExciting new plans come and go. This one seemed as likely as so many others but Covid-19 has shifted the picture even further. Every league, every club is facing a financial nosedive, their power tied inexorably to those freeze-framed TV deals. \u201cFootball can \u2013 and I believe will \u2013 play a big part in helping our world recover,\u201d Infantino mused last week, no doubt pondering the majesty of his organisation\u2019s bank balance and with the next major Fifa payday safely tucked away in late 2022.\nNobody really knows what the world will look like once normalisation returns to all of us but some certainties do remain. Resistance, as the case of the TTFA demonstrates, is still futile and right now Fifa is in a position to bend that future to its will.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/17/resistance-fifa-futile-prepare-to-be-normalised-football-broadcast-rights", "title": "Resistance to Fifa is futile: fall in line or prepare to be Normalised", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 18:00:46 GMT", "summary": "<p>There is plenty up for grabs after the collapse of club football\u2019s TV rights power base \u2013 and Fifa is ready to grab it</p><p>Nobody wants a visit from <a href=\"https://www.fifa.com/fifaeworldcup/news/fifa-establish-normalisation-committee-the-samoa-799597\">the Normalisation Committee</a>.

There was more than a grain of truth in the assertion, though rather than being a menace on the pitch Hunter, whose death at the age of 76 \n, was simply a brusquely physical defensive presence of a type common at the time.\nEvery team seemed to have a strongman with a memorable and fondly bestowed pet name \u2013 Liverpool had Tommy \u201cAnfield Iron\u201d Smith and Chelsea had Ron \u201cChopper\u201d Harris \u2013 and though some of the tackling might be considered hair-raising by modern standards, half a century ago it was just part of the game. In a way Hunter did bite yer legs \u2013 opponents had to be good or quick to get past him \u2013 but first and foremost he was an excellent defender, not merely the enforcer his sobriquet tends to suggest.\nHad Hunter not been able to play good football he would have been nowhere near a World Cup final at the age of 22. The reason he was unable to break into the side was because Alf Ramsey had decided Bobby Moore and Jack Charlton formed the best centre-back partnership and neither player became injured or did anything to warrant being replaced. Hunter just had to wait until 1970 but even then he found Everton\u2019s experienced Brian Labone had moved ahead in the queue to play alongside Moore.\nHunter did manage to make an appearance in the ill-fated quarter-final against West Germany in Leon. He came on for Martin Peters with nine minutes remaining only to see Uwe Seeler send the game into extra time then Gerd M\u00fcller supply the Germany winner.\nThe defender\u2019s luck was no better when he finally managed to break into the England team. He had replaced Moore in the side at long last for the 1973 game against Poland at Wembley that Ramsey\u2019s team needed to win to qualify for the following year\u2019s World Cup but ended up blaming himself for a mistake the visitors capitalised on to take the lead. Though \n equalised, the win eluded them and for Ramsey as well as Hunter the World Cup trail came to an abrupt end.\nWhile Hunter might have won more than 28 caps had he played at a time when England were not quite as well-equipped with centre-backs, his club career at least was eventful and rewarding. He played 726 times for Leeds after being scouted as a Gateshead schoolboy and signing on at the age of 15, making his debut at 19 and forming a partnership with Charlton that would last a decade.\nDon Revie\u2019s side were promoted from the Second Division in 1964 and were on course for a league and Cup double in the following season before losing to Liverpool in the 1965 FA Cup final and being pipped to the title by Manchester United on goal average.\nCompensation for those disappointments arrived later in the decade as Leeds built on their success to become the strongest team in the country as the 60s turned into the 70s. Not necessarily the prettiest or best-liked, as Clough as Leeds manager \n, but there was no arguing with the eventual success under Revie, or that Elland Road had become the most daunting stadium for opposing teams.\nWith Hunter a fixture in the side, Leeds won the title in 1969 and 1974, the FA Cup in 1972, and were losing finalists to Sunderland at Wembley a year later. The 1972-73 season also brought defeat in the European Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final by Milan, a match in which Hunter was dismissed for retaliation at the end amid protests from the crowd over the impartiality of a referee who would receive a ban for match-fixing in subsequent games.\nHowever that controversy was nothing next to the heated disputes over disallowed goals and non-awarded penalties that disfigured the 1975 European Cup final against Bayern Munich.\nFranz Beckenbauer\u2019s side won 2-0, though many still feel that Leeds, now being looked after by Jimmy Armfield after Revie had moved on to England, were cheated in Paris. The violent reaction from sections of the Leeds support resulted in the club being banned from European competition for two years, though it never needed to be applied as the great Elland Road years were effectively over.\nHunter moved on to Bristol City in 1976. The \u00a340,000 fee was an eye-catching one for a 33-year-old and Hunter played more than 100 games for the Robins before moving back north to end his career with Barnsley. He tried his hand at management when he finished playing at Oakwell, lasting four years after taking over from Allan Clarke, though a later spell at Rotherham was shorter and his last.\nInevitably, perhaps, he spent later years as a meeter and greeter back at Elland Road, where he has a banqueting suite named in his honour. Every club should make the most of its legends, after all, and club legends do not come much bigger or bolder than Norman Hunter.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/apr/17/how-norman-hunter-became-one-of-leeds-uniteds-biggest-legends", "title": "How Norman Hunter became one of Leeds United's greatest legends | Paul Wilson", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 10:31:12 GMT", "summary": "<p>Nicknamed \u2018Norman bites yer legs\u2019, the Leeds defender won 28 England caps but had his biggest successes at Elland Road</p><p>Norman Hunter had to wait 41 years for his World Cup winners\u2019 medal \u2013 as a non-playing member of England\u2019s 1966 squad he was not deemed entitled to one until the <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2007/nov/25/newsstory.sport9\" title=\"\">rules were eventually revised</a> \u2013 yet the Leeds United centre-half\u2019s no-nonsense playing style is as fondly remembered today as any other from the era when televised football turned local heroes into household names.</p><p>Partly that is to do with the wonderfully apposite nickname that followed him around after the 1972 FA Cup final against Arsenal, when a banner in the Leeds end declaring \u201cNorman bites yer legs\u201d was spotted and commented on by the studio pundit Brian Clough.

A new two-year contract signed in March will take the 27-year-old into her 13th year with the club. Plenty of players have been ditched by Emma Hayes, with the manager unsentimental in her quest for success, but Spence, the only player to have been at the club longer than Hayes, remains firmly in the manager\u2019s plans.\nIt is a huge vote of confidence for the midfielder, yet the respect of one of the most experienced club managers in the game, two league titles, a Spring Series trophy, two FA Cups and, this year, the team\u2019s \n, have not been enough to earn her a place in Phil Neville\u2019s England squad.\nSpence admits \u201cthe squad is difficult to get in, especially my position, because there\u2019s so many good midfielders in England. It\u2019s tough\u201d. However with defenders such as Lucy Bronze and Leah Williamson filling in in midfield and formations tweaked game by game to try to compensate for injuries, the inability of Spence to get a look-in seems odd.\n\u201cPhil\u2019s not spoken to me once,\u201d says the softly spoken Spence, with no anger but a tinge of disappointment. \u201cTo not be given that chance makes me question: \u2018Is it because of what happened?\u2019 I think it is because of what happened, if I\u2019m totally honest.\u201d\nSpence is referring to her involvement in the Mark Sampson racism case. In 2017, when her then Chelsea teammate \n after taking part in an anonymous questionnaire on the culture within the national team, Spence was pulled into the ring as the unnamed player who, while the only player of colour in the room, had been asked by Sampson how many times she had been arrested. Initially Spence stayed quiet before writing to the FA to confirm Aluko\u2019s account of the event.\nAfter a very public and messy series of investigations, \n to both Spence and Aluko. The latter did not play for England again, but with more than 100 caps and the end of her career a bit closer she was aware she had less to lose by speaking out.\nSpence, who was 25 and had attended only one England camp, under Sampson, stayed quiet in an attempt to protect her position. \u201cThe reason I didn\u2019t speak out straight away was because I was worried,\u201d she says. \u201cI was stressed at the time. There was a lot going on behind closed doors. My main concern was whether it would affect me playing for my country. I\u2019m happy with the decision I took \u2013 I didn\u2019t speak out then, it wouldn\u2019t have been right.\u201d\nShe has had one call-up since, for the squad\u2019s training camp in La Manga in the immediate aftermath under the interim manager Mo Marley, but she is a little sceptical of the intent behind her selection, speculating over whether it was to make the FA \u201clook good in the media\u201d. The FA said in a statement on Friday that \u201cplayers are only ever picked on merit and all English players in the WSL are watched and considered for selection\u201d.\nReflecting on the situation triggers a little frustration, but for now Spence is relaxed about her international future. Why? Because at Chelsea she has Hayes\u2019s trust and feels valued. \u201cRight now I\u2019m not losing any sleep over it,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got a good career at Chelsea, we\u2019re winning titles, we\u2019re challenging every season, so I\u2019m happy with my status at the moment.\u201d\nHer life at Chelsea is by no means a walk in the park. Staying in Hayes\u2019s plans is tough. She had eight league starts this season \u2013 she started 15 games in 2018-19 \u2013 before it was \n. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult for me because a lot of people always write me off,\u201d she says. \u201cEvery year, I\u2019ve got to push myself. I know there\u2019s going to be signings coming in every year.\n\u201cEmma\u2019s made that clear every season really, to make sure that the squad is pushing again and pushing to another level. It\u2019s just really believing in myself, making sure I\u2019m doing everything right in training every day and competing with the players that come in.\u201d\nHayes\u2019s \u201chonesty\u201d in telling her where she needs to improve, and her willingness to adapt and take it on board, is the secret to her longevity at the club. \u201cEmma can rely on me to be put in wherever she\u2019s needed me,\u201d Spence says. \u201cI\u2019ve played higher and lower. I\u2019ve even played out wide sometimes, which is definitely not my game. Emma always wants a player that can play in different positions so she makes you adapt.\u201d\nHayes prides herself on building teams of leaders, of finding the \u201cright players\u201d, and that approach has yielded trophies. Before the season was suspended, Chelsea were one point behind Manchester City with a game in hand and a domestic treble in their sights having lifted the League Cup in February.\nThe desire for the missing piece, that elusive Champions League, is huge, says Spence: \u201cWe were so unlucky last year not to make the final [\n]. Some people say that you make your own luck but we should\u2019ve made the final with the chances that we created.\n\u201cObviously, not being in the Champions League this year was even more frustrating. If we don\u2019t win it in the next two years I feel like it\u2019ll be a massive failure to be honest, because the team we have at the moment can easily win the Champions League. I think everyone knows that.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/17/drew-spence-phils-not-spoken-to-me-once-is-it-because-of-what-happened", "title": "Drew Spence: 'Phil's not spoken to me once.

These are the rules that would apply in training and matches to safeguard against the spread of the virus.\nOne key aspect of the protocols would be testing. While the presumption is that any resumption of the 2019-20 season would be made behind closed doors, testing of everyone involved in a given event \u2013 from players, to coaching and medical staff, match officials and TV broadcast crews \u2013 would be necessary.\nA recent calculation in relation to the German Bundesliga\u2019s plans for \u201cghost games\u201d estimated 240 people would be required for each match.

The second World Cup semi-final at Twickenham in 1999 seems like yesterday to me even though \u00c9mile Ntamack, France\u2019s left-wing on that autumn day, now watches his son play for their country. No one in the stadium will ever forget it. At the end, and I kid you not, I turned round from my seat in the East stand press box and grown men were actually weeping.\nContext is all. This wasn\u2019t just an astonishing spectacle. It came, like so many French performances in World Cups, completely out of the blue. The All Blacks were so far ahead of everyone it wasn\u2019t true. Jonah Lomu was in his pomp and their backline, with Christian Cullen, Tana Umaga and Jeff Wilson operating outside Andrew Mehrtens, were cutting other teams to shreds.\nEarlier in the competition New Zealand cold-bloodedly scored 101 points against Italy in Huddersfield. They had been beaten in the final four years ago when Nelson Mandela was South Africa\u2019s 16th man and they were going to make no mistakes this time.\nFrance were their usual flaky but often brilliant selves and nobody was giving them a hope. This view was shared by the Guardian\u2019s newly appointed rugby correspondent. \u201cI\u2019ll do Australia against South Africa, should be pretty good, and you can watch the All Blacks beat France,\u201d the sage-like Robert Kitson told me during the week. (He may not have used those actual words but you have to allow me a little one-upmanship and smugness for this feature).\nAnd so it came to pass. Rob watched the thrilling spectacle of Matt Burke kicking eight penalties against the holders while I, bless him, went to Twickenham 24 hours later to witness what Paul Simon might have called \u201ca day of miracles and wonders\u201d. My only regret is that the following weekend Australia beat a flat France, perhaps shattered after their semi-final efforts , in the dullest final ever.\nAll was going to the script as New Zealand ran up a 24-10 lead. A black tidal wave threatened to submerge France. Lomu powered through the tackles of Xavier Garbajosa, Philippe Bernat-Salles and Fabien Galthi\u00e9 as if they were so much dead wood in an autumn gale. The full-back Garbajosa later admitted that he had deliberately dived the wrong way to avoid the express train that was Lomu and who could blame him? Poor France, their Six Nations wooden spoon earlier that year was going to be followed by a humiliation witnessed by millions.\nAnd then the rugby world was turned upside down. France scored 33 points without reply. Their fly-half Christophe Lamaison, only in the side because Thomas Castaign\u00e8de was injured, kicked two drop-goals and two penalties. France were within touching distance. Fear gripped the All Blacks. Surely they couldn\u2019t muck this one up? We were on the edge of our seats.\nThe scrum-half Galthie, now France\u2019s head coach, kicked a teasing up-and-under down the left touchline. Christophe Dominici thundered after it and raced round Mehrtens to score. France were ahead. Pandemonium broke out. The French pack rumbled forwards.\nBy this time Lamaison could do nothing wrong. His chip bounced into the arms of Richard Dourthe, who scored another. With five minutes to go, though, New Zealand still had shots to fire. Mehrtens flung a pass to Umaga but the wing could not hold it and Lamaison kicked the ball from the French 22. Olivier Magne hacked it on into the New Zealand half and Bernat-Salles won the race with Wilson to plunge over.\nThere was no way back despite Wilson\u2019s last-minute reply. Never before had the All Blacks conceded so many points in a World Cup game. I\u2019ve been lucky enough to see two other remarkable World Cup games live, Fiji against Wales at Nantes in 2007 and Japan beating South Africa in Brighton in 2015 are up there, but nothing matches this.\nWhen I got my breath back I phoned the Guardian sports desk. \u201cI\u2019ve just seen the greatest game in the history of the World Cup,\u201d I said. \u201cYes, we know,\u201d came the weary reply. (I was forgetting that everyone was watching on telly.) \u201cThat\u2019s why \n.\u201d Ah.

Tannehill was let go by the Dolphins after years of bang average interspersed with brief flashes of brilliance \u2013 most notably a season that was cut short by a knee injury when Tannehill looked like he had finally pieced it all together.\nThe Dolphins bailed. Tannehill was shipped to Tennessee. He rode the bench for a little while then took the lead role when Marcus Mariota was benched for his own stretch of mundane play. Then, \n.\nTannehill exploded into, legitimately, one of the five best quarterbacks in the league. That sounds like hyperbole, but it\u2019s a fact. By the metrics, Tannehill finished fifth or better in each of the following categories: DVOA, completion percentage under pressure, completion percentage to targets in tight coverage, completion percentage from a clean pocket, completion percentage on third downs.\nYou might be able to bluff one of the metrics, but not \nMost importantly, he ranked second in the league in big-time throws v turnover worthy throws, the single best measure we currently have of a quarterback as a \u201cpassing playmaker\u201d. He trailed only Russell Wilson and was comfortably ahead of Aaron Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes.\nAnd the eye test was no different. Take the nameplate of his back and you would be conceived you were watching a perennial All-Pro: throws to all levels; consistently nailing the so-called bucket throw, dropping a pass over the top of a linebacker and in front of a rotating safety; throwing on the run; running; setting and resetting protections; taking command of the whole offense; making, big, BIG time throws on third downs, the one that decide a game or not.\nTannehill was reborn. And while it\u2019s tempting to scoff at the Titans \n to keep him around for the foreseeable future, what else were they supposed to do? Move on after witnessing that?\nTannehill will likely regress back to his mean: an above-average starter who needs a good deal of help around but who can move and create on third downs, create off-script, and has a cannon of an arm. But there\u2019s a chance, albeit a slight one, that something has clicked. That his second act is sustainable, if only for another season.\nSo, who\u2019s next? Across the league young veterans have switched teams, looking for a chance, any chance to land that sweet gig; that moment in time when an offensive guru meets a gifted offensive line, a pair of decent receivers and a complimentary running back. When perhaps a starter goes down and it\u2019s your time.\nThe two most fascinating possibilities: Marcus Mariota and \n.\nNewton, a former No 1 overall pick and \n is still searching for a team after his \n from the Panthers.\nOrdinarily, that would be bonkers. Whether you think Newton is on the downside of career or not, he remains a starting-caliber quarterback in a league that\u2019s lacking them. But Newton\u2019s checkered injury record makes any potential signing an impossibility right now.\nAny team who would be willing to commit big money to the 30-year-old \u2013 and Newton will likely command big money, even if only on a one-year deal \u2013 will want to work Newton out to make sure he still has the same oomph in his legs and zip on his fastball, not to mention have their own medical experts take a look at his files. Until the current global pandemic subsides, that\u2019s going to be a near-impossibility.\nAt the peak of his powers, Newton was a singular force: A blend of size, speed and arm strength the quarterback position has never seen. He was a linebacker in the backfield, but one with just enough touch to shred defenses down the field. He helped take the Panthers to a Super Bowl in a funky offense that was built around his own quirks: his willingness to bang between the tackles and his penchant to mistime some of dropbacks, leading the team to take a whole bunch of timing routes out of the system. It worked! Newton was pretty much unstoppable. But he\u2019s regressed since then. Injuries have taken over and his accuracy, which has always fluctuated based on his footwork, has become wince-inducing.\nBut think how wild that above paragraph is. How odd it is to write about the past being the peak of Newton\u2019s powers. \n should be his peak. He\u2019s 30, still blessed with all the physical gifts he\u2019s always possessed but also with all the experience and savvy of a veteran. This is when he should be staking his claim as one of the league\u2019s five most important players on a consistent basis, serving as the linchpin of perennial Super Bowl contender, not sitting out as a street free agent trying to prove he still has \nThe spot that makes the most sense for a Newton comeback is in Los Angeles with the Chargers. Right now, LA lists Tyrod Taylor as its starter, with head coach Anthony Lynn saying he\u2019s \u201ctheir guy\u201d. The only issue, we\u2019ve seen systems built around Taylor before in Buffalo (with Lynn) and Cleveland. Neither started or ended particularly well.\nTaylor is a fine backup, but he\u2019s a couple of ticks below Newton on the quarterback index. If the Chargers want to move away from the dropback passing system they ran with Philip Rivers and commit to the spread option, why do that with a smaller, leaner version or Newton rather than the real deal? Taylor might be a \nbit more accurate as a passer. But it\u2019s a nominal difference, and he\u2019s also far less aggressive. Rolling with Taylor is an admission that a team is happy to be average-to-bad.\nNewton, at least, improves that risk profile to good-to-bad \u2013 that\u2019s a gamble worth taking. Add to that, with Rivers leaving the Charges could use a little bit of star power, particularly as they get set to move into a new stadium. There are few higher-wattage stars in the league than Newton.\nOne other option: The Rams. Sean McVay\u2019s team is in cap hell and have been flogging assets. And you could make a decent argument, based on scheme-fit and accuracy without pressure, that you\u2019d rather have Jared Goff than Newton. But I\u2019d trust in McVay to adapt his system, and I\u2019d sooner take the quarterback who is the same when pressured and when not, rather than the guy who\u2019s accuracy and decision-making craters when there\u2019s pressure in his face.\nWould Newton be open to a one-year, cheap deal to work alongside McVay and make a potential Super Bowl run? The idea is fairly tantalizing.\nBut Mariota to the Vegas Raiders remains the most likely breakout/rebirth spot.\nMariota was lethal in college in an offense that weaponized his north-south speed and lightning-quick release. He was smart, played within himself, got the ball out on time, and was all about maximizing efficiency, both with his arm and legs. He\u2019s a timing player, not an oft-script creator. Planting him in a system that says \n was never his style; thrust into that position he crumbled.\n\u201cWe got to rebuild him a little bit to get his confidence back,\u201d Las Vegas general manager Mike Mayock said this week. By that, Mayock meant to restore him to his Oregon days. \u201cI mean, he went through \u2018Gruden\u2019s (QB) Camp\u2019 on television. I had him as the top quarterback in that draft. He knows that both of us believed in him coming out and still believe in him.\u201d\nIn Jon Gruden, Mariota finds a coach who sees his skills as a virtue, not a shortcoming. Is he a game-breaker? No. Can he efficiently take a team down the field, play within structure, make sure the team gets from a bad play into a good one, follow instructions, make throws on time and in rhythm, and lead a team to eight or nine wins, giving them a playoff shot? Sure.\nMariota will have to beat out Derek Carr, who is due for his own second act any year now. Carr has been solid if unspectacular since Gruden returned to the Raiders, happy to take on the coach\u2019s touchdown-or-checkdown mantra. But the fit remains iffy. Mariota\u2019s arrival, as well as a brief flirtation with Tom Brady, tells you all you need to know about how Mayock and Gruden view Carr\u2019s future with the team.\nWe love a redemption arc, that\u2019s just human nature.

However, the decision to go ahead with it has drawn fierce criticism from Devi Sridhar, chair of Global Public Health at the University of Edinburgh and an adviser on the pandemic to the Scottish government, who described it as \n. \u201cThe wise thing to do is cancel for this year,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a painful decision but they have no choice.\u201d\n\u201cThere will be a lot of debate generated about the rights and wrongs of the transitions out of lockdown across all aspects of society, including sporting events,\u201d Brailsford said. \u201cEqually, most people recognise that the learning from transitioning out of lockdown will only take place once it begins. We will monitor the situation very carefully and of course take note of national guidance and all advice.\u201d\nJonathan Vaughters, manager of the US-based Education First team, said he believed the Tour\u2019s promoter, ASO, had ruled out the option of a Tour \u201cbehind closed doors\u201d \u2013 without roadside spectators, \u2013 too hastily. \u201cI don\u2019t see the logic in declaring that they would not have it behind closed doors,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that wouldn\u2019t be tradition, but that seems a good option to me, because you\u2019re minimising risk. I don\u2019t want to see that option eliminated. If I was them, I would consider that a serious option, rather than their stance which seems to be, \u2018it\u2019s all or nothing\u2019.\u201d\nLike Brailsford, Vaughters confirmed both he and his team\u2019s sponsor would be seeking assurances from the Tour organisation. \u201cWe would want to see proper mitigation techniques before the event,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe by July or August the virus has abated to the point that it\u2019s not such a risk, but I can say that if there is a risk of a second wave that the Tour might be part of, then we would demand that there would be major mitigation before the event.\n\u201cIt\u2019s probably a good idea to quarantine the riders before the start,\u201d he said, \u201cbut the attitude from ASO seems \u2018it\u2019s either the way we have always done it or not at all\u2019, which is maybe a little short-sighted on their part. It\u2019s better to bring in these extra measures than not have the race at all.\u201d\nVaughters acknowledged that the desire to hold the Tour was good news for cycling\u2019s business model, however. He added: \u201cThe Tour could be a bellwether for the economy because if it happens, it\u2019s a sign that things are improving.

For his club Vissel Kobe, Emperor\u2019s Cup winners in January, the new J-League season started on 21 February and stopped again four days later due to the coronavirus crisis. It was due to restart on 15 March, then 29 March, and then 6 May. Now they hope it might be on 9 May. But who knows? And that is in a country seen as a model of pandemic management, one where, Iniesta says thankfully, \u201cthe situation appears to be under control\u201d.\nIt is just before dinner time, another evening on lockdown in his family flat, high above the city and about 6,500 miles from home in \n. \u201cThere will,\u201d he adds, \u201cbe a before and after.\u201d Quite what that after looks like is a question that lingers, for football and for him.\nBy the time the J League resumes, Iniesta could well be 36 (his birthday is on 11 May). This could be a watershed, time perhaps to look to retirement plans \u2013 coaching, rarely associated with him, comes up in conversation \u2013 but he resists. In fact, Iniesta thinks \u201call this time not playing will give me the energy to keep going even longer\u201d.\nUntil then, time drags on.\n\u201cFrom the start of the virus, schools were closed, mass gatherings were cancelled. Things like wearing masks, some of the hygiene measures, are normal here anyway and that\u2019s helped to reduce the spread,\u201d Iniesta says. \u201cNow we\u2019re just waiting, staying home, going out as little as possible. The little ones [Valeria, 9; Paolo Andrea, 4; Siena, just about to turn 3; plus Romeo, ten months] are doing classes online. They know there\u2019s a virus that\u2019s dangerous.\u201d\nThe kids stay in and back in the tiny village of Fuentealbilla, population 1,816, so do Iniesta\u2019s parents. Attention turns to Spain. \u201cAll sorts of things go through your mind,\u201d he says. \u201cPeople are handling it naturally here [but] maybe we\u2019re more influenced by what we see or read about Spain than what\u2019s actually happening here. Here you can go for a walk [unlike Spain], but sometimes we don\u2019t because you\u2019re influenced by Spain, thinking: \u2018Is it the right thing to do?\u2019 That can be disconcerting.\n\u201cViruses, and this virus in particular, is a bit unpredictable. You ask yourself when can we get back to normal life? When can we leave our homes? When can we give each other a hug? We don\u2019t know if the weather improving will mean the virus is reduced like any other virus or the flu, if a vaccine will be found? All those things are up in the air.\u201d\nThe football season, too. \u201cThe key moment was the [Tokyo] Olympics,\u201d Iniesta explains. \u201cThey tried everything for it to go ahead. Once it was postponed [giving the J-league more room for manoeuvre in July and August], the league decided not to return until 9 May. So that\u2019s when we go back \u2026 in theory. Not having a clear target is hard. There have been moments when we thought we were going back this day or that day, then it\u2019s paused again.\n\u201cWhen it comes to preparation, planning, motivation, stepping up your training because games are approaching \u2026 well, it\u2019s impossible. You train full-on when there\u2019s still a month left, or maybe more. The good thing,\u201d Iniesta says, \u201cis we\u2019ve only played one game.\u201d\nIt is easier to let go, in other words. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be dramatic but you can see it\u2019s going to be really difficult for this [season] to be completed,\u201d he adds. \u201cHopefully there will be a turnaround and everything changes radically for the better, but getting back to playing looks difficult now.\u201d\n\u201cI suppose there will be rules that decide [outcomes] one way or another in exceptional circumstances, but it\u2019s a difficult situation. It must be very hard [for teams like Liverpool, who may be denied a title]. Or a second division team on the verge of being promoted, told this season is null and void, that it doesn\u2019t count. Or, the other way round: a team in the relegation zone is saved. \n. I don\u2019t know how you resolve it.\n\u201cIn the short to medium-term the virus is bound to have a social and economic impact, on every level. Football is part of society; it can\u2019t escape that. You feel a responsibility to do the right thing as a person and as someone in the public eye. This will have an impact; there will be measures that stay in place, changes, a before and after. We have to try to make the best of a terrible situation.\u201d\nCould one benefit be that clubs, hit economically, are forced to draw on their youth systems? At Barcelona, perhaps it could force a return to an identity built on La Masia \u2013 \n in the shadow of the Camp Nou where Iniesta lived \n, a small boy in tears? A return to the days when the Ballon d\u2019Or podium was all Barcelona youth-teamers, Iniesta standing with Xavi and Lionel Messi, the only one of the three remaining.\nFor many, these have been days of nostalgia. For Iniesta, too, completing the documentary that follows his biography, touching on \n \n and in South Africa; \n; the death of his friend, the Espanyol captain Dani Jarque; and now his new life in Japan with his wife, Anna.\nThere is one thing he still doesn\u2019t reveal: what Frank Rijkaard said after leaving him out of the side for the 2006 European Cup final. \u201cIt would be wrong to repeat the words he said to me,\u201d Iniesta says. Then there\u2019s a joke, lost down the line. Nor, speaking of jokes, is the moment when he met Peter Crouch in the film \u2013 a running gag in the former England striker\u2019s podcast \u2013 and why would it be? \u201cI\u2019m aware of it,\u201d Iniesta says, \u201cI just don\u2019t remember if it was me who asked for the photo or if it was him.\u201d Crouch would like to come to Japan, he is told. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll be here,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat\u2019s he up to right now?\u201d\nOtherwise, it\u2019s all there. \u201cGood moments, bad moments. I have always been clear that this has been my way of doing things, respecting others, trusting in myself, confronting things as they have presented themselves, taking them on without complaining when I wasn\u2019t playing or when I saw something that wasn\u2019t fair, always trying to make the most of the opportunity to play. And in the end, that\u2019s the point: it\u2019s about how you approach it.\u201d\nIt\u2019s about the journey, one for for which he notes in one moment of the film: \u201cI paid the toll.\u201d That is most visible in the eyes of his parents, Jos\u00e9 Antonio and Mari. \u201cMy mum has almost never spoken publicly and it\u2019s emotional hearing her,\u201d Iniesta says. Yet, the moment when the passing of time is marked and melancholy most takes hold may even be when Messi talks about their generation, the finest in Barcelona\u2019s history: in the tone, the eyes, the slipping away of his sentence, there\u2019s a realisation that \n.\nIt is hard not to link that to the moment the club is going through now, \n. Barcelona can feel like it has lost its religion, La Masia less-fertile ground now; more a battleground instead. Those days seem a long way off, even though Iniesta departed less than two years ago, \n, and \n a year before that. \n, \n, and \n remain but are all well into their second decade at the club.\n\u201cThat generation will never be repeated but what follows does not have to necessarily be worse in terms of how the club fares,\u201d Iniesta says. \u201cI had seen Puyi go, \n, and then Xavi had gone \u2026 you concentrate on your own day-to-day, you still have a great team around you, top players.\u201d\nYet you can\u2019t help wondering if a player like Iniesta would be given the chance any more. If something has been lost and the only way to recover \n, is to recover that generation, bring them back. Worse, you cannot help wondering \n; if it need not \n, his departure linked to the drift, a disconnect. In the film, that hint hangs heavy, a lingering sense that there is blame to be apportioned.\n\u201cErm \u2026 \u2018blame\u2019, no \u2026 it\u2019s no one\u2019s fault. In the end, things happen the way they have to happen. And they happened like that and I took the decision because I felt it was the one that I had to take.\u201d\nHad to? \u201cIt is true that if things are done differently you feel differently. I say that very clearly: it\u2019s like a relationship and in a relationship if you have a problem with your wife or with a friend and you don\u2019t talk, you don\u2019t talk, and then the moment comes that you do talk, things have already deteriorated or one person thinks one thing, another [thinks] another. But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s blame, because everyone sees things in a different way and all I am doing is giving my opinion and for sure on the other side there is another opinion.\n\u201cThere have been all sorts of eras in the club\u2019s history: young players used to get a chance in the first team when results were bad and they had to turn to the youth team. That happened in my era,\u201d Iniesta says.\n\u201cBut then you have the period when you have 10, 11, 12 players from the youth team in the first-team squad. It depends on who the coach is, the situation of the club, but I always think that a player in the youth system who is good enough to play in the first team reaches the first team.\n\u201cIt was many years living this club, growing up here since we were very young, getting into the first team and staying there for 10, 12, 15 years, becoming captains. We were all \n here as people. It\u2019s difficult for something like that to happen. It\u2019s \n difficult. We\u2019re talking about \n, a club with the best players. V\u00edctor, Puyol, Xavi, me: we came up in a scenario to Busi [Sergio Busquets], Piqu\u00e9, and Leo [Messi].\n\u201cWe\u2019re people who have been at the club our whole lives and we have that \u2018plus\u2019 that others don\u2019t have. The moment could come when all of those players coincide at the club [again]. Without doubt, the likes of V\u00edctor, Xavi, Puyol, have to go back because it wouldn\u2019t make sense for them not to.\u201d\nAnd you? \u201cRight now, I\u2019m trying to extend my playing career as much as possible, I want to kick a ball for as long as I can because that\u2019s what makes me happy. I\u2019ve got a contract until next year, 2021, but I\u2019m looking at things at the end of every season and I feel good, motivated. I want to keep playing and we\u2019re delighted to be here.\n\u201cWhen it does end, I have always said that I would love to go back to Bar\u00e7a. It all depends on how? In what role? What situation? Who is at the club? That\u2019s some way off. But with everything I experienced there, all the feelings I have, I would love to go back.\u201d\nThe next cycle has already begun. In January, Barcelona offered the manager\u2019s job to Xavi, Iniesta\u2019s midfield partner, defenders of a footballing faith. Xavi turned it down, for now, but admits that he does want to return to coach the team. V\u00edctor Font is preparing his candidacy to be president of the club in 2021, in opposition to the current board, and Xavi would be his manager.

Hand-clap emojis; \u201cClass\u201d; we deserve more; get rid of greed in football (seriously!) \u2013 and not just from long-suffering fans, from paid observers too.\nAt which point it is necessary to take a step back, slap yourself a few hundred times around the head to shake off the cognitive dissonance, and attempt to process how the scales of good and bad seem to work around here. Exit, the House of Karrimor. Enter, the austere and unforgiving House of Saud, a process that is somehow being hailed as a victory for \u201clovers\u201d; and the end (more laughter in the dark) of the cynical commodifying of \n.\nPerhaps it is time here for a tale of the tape. Mike Ashley: pig-headed retail magnate. Saudi Arabia: blood-stained inherited dictatorship. Mike Ashley: zero hours contracts in his sports shops. Saudi Arabia: beheaded 37 men in a single day. Mike Ashley: showed disrespect to Rafa Ben\u00edtez. Saudi Arabia: murdered and dismembered Jamal Khashoggi. Is this useful at all?\nAshley wants to sell you a cheap nylon tracksuit. \n wants to sell you a soft-focus view of its oppressive regime, safe in the knowledge that a mega-spending spree will provide instant distraction, thereby treating the fanbase of a great British football club as useful idiots in the soft\u2011power game. \u201cWe\u2019re getting our club back,\u201d has been a refrain in the last few days. Really? Because it looks more like something more precious is being taken away.\nIn the meantime, yes, the Saudis are finally here. This kind of deal can always hit a late snag. But given the chairman of the Saudi Private Investment Fund, Mohammed bin Salman, owns a painting that cost more than Newcastle, it seems likely any hitches can be smoothed over. At the end of which the Public Investment Fund of Saudi Arabia (PIF) will own an 80% stake in the club.\nYou might wonder why a \u00a3300bn fund would want a football\u2011friendly businesswoman and two local property developers to own the other 20%. Well, maybe it\u2019s because they\u2019re a football-friendly businesswoman and two local property developers. It certainly breaks up the row of grinning beards. And let\u2019s be clear: image, spin and reputation management is the game here.\nFor now it also means this conversation must happen again, the one where a liberal-left newspaper suggests that this is not a desirable entity to own a community-centred football club. In return a small, vocal swathe of that club\u2019s online support will click into gear, warrior cells in the sportswashing immune system, and suggest that to point this out is unfair, biased and typically loaded against [insert name of club here].\nTo date the most common responses have included: you never mentioned Club X or indeed Club Y, who are also owned by sportswashing regimes. Another popular theme is that journalists stick up for Mike Ashley because he\u2019s \u201cfrom London\u201d (Ashley is from Buckinghamshire. Mohammed bin Salman, on the other hand, is much more of a Londoner: he does at least own a fair bit of it).\nThis time, however, it does feel as though something has changed. Perhaps we are at a tipping point in this process. Because the whataboutery does actually have some substance. Newcastle may be the headline act, but they\u2019re not even half the story.\nIf we really are to make a stand on this, to suggest that a regime where homosexuality is punishable by flogging (awkward Rainbow Laces day ahead) isn\u2019t a desirable guest at the top table of British sport, then that process is going to require a hasty rewind. The fact is, the Saudis aren\u2019t coming. They\u2019re already here, carried through the financial arms of the PIF like some irresistible super\u2011virus particle.\nThe Premier League is already a willing host. Manchester United have a tie-in with the Saudi General Sports Authority, adjunct to their longstanding deal with the Saudi telecoms agency. West Ham are 10% owned by Blackstone Finance, part-funded by the Saudis. Saudi Arabia owns a stake in Uber, who have previously teamed up with Chelsea. By the same conduit the Saudis in effect sponsor 5% of Mo Salah.\nIt is a process to which the wider world of sport has already given in. We are all Saudis now, touched in some form by the success of the 2016 national transformation project, designed to diminish Saudi dependence on oil and create a pop-up global leisure economy.\nThe WWE and world boxing are on board. Even dear old moral high hats Barcelona have a commercial link with Samba, a Saudi finance company.\nIt\u2019s no secret why this is happening. Throwing money into sport is a shortcut to cultural legitimacy, and certainly much easier than keeping Amnesty International happy. The question is what, if anything, those who still have the will to see sporting clubs as a special case, a protected industry, are willing to do about it.\nThere are some changes that could help. A rule against sovereign wealth funds owning majority stakes in football clubs would be a start. Some kind of genuine fit and proper test is conceivable, one that involves a clearly defined notion of moral probity.\nAnd yet, you can already feel this collapsing. In a world where nobody is clean, where every hedge fund is connected to something grey, where even professional journalists struggle to see the difference between the harm done by leveraged buyouts and the moral vacuity of nation-state reputation washing, it is easy to fall into moral relativism, to lose any confidence in the ability to say this is not a desirable outcome.\nAt the end of which Mohammed bin Salman is coming up the path in a black and white striped shirt. And the unregulated, entirely commercial Premier League has taken another decisive step down a path from which it will struggle to return.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/16/exit-the-house-of-karrimor-enter-the-austere-and-unforgiving-house-of-saud", "title": "Exit, the House of Karrimor.

Now the American teenager prematurely regarded by many as the eventual successor to the 38-year-old Serena Williams has spoken for the first time about how her life was descending into a nightmare before her career had properly begun.\nGauff, who turned 16 last month, says her doubts about embracing a life in tennis crystallised when she first played at Wimbledon as a junior, a year before her \n in the championships last summer.\n\u201cRight before Wimbledon, going back to around 2017-18, even though I had, it felt like there weren\u2019t many friends there for me,\u201d she writes in Behind The Racquet, an online platform for players to tell their story in their own words.\n\u201cWhen you are in that dark mindset, you don\u2019t look on the bright side of things too often, which is the hardest part. I don\u2019t think it had much to do with tennis, maybe just about juggling it all. I knew that I wanted to play tennis but didn\u2019t know how I wanted to go about it.\n\u201cIt went so far that I was thinking about possibly taking a year off to just focus on life. Choosing not to, obviously, was the right choice but I was close to not going in that direction. I was just lost. I was confused and overthinking if this was what I wanted or what others did.\n\u201cIt took many moments sitting, thinking and crying. I came out of it stronger and knowing myself better than ever. Everyone asks me how I stay calm on court and I think it\u2019s because I accepted who I am after overcoming low points in my life. Now, when I\u2019m on court, I am just really thankful to be out there.\u201d\nGauff quickly built on her Wimbledon achievement, and expectations rose further when, awarded a wildcard, \n, then the \n, where, for the second time in seven months, she \n.\nAll the while, she presented a disarmingly mature front, surprising even seasoned observers with her calmness as big contracts rolled in and experienced opponents succumbed to her big serve, solid ground strokes and all-round tennis smarts. The hype was properly kicking in. No turning back. Only glory beckoned. Just as Serena was fighting to seal her legacy with a 24th major that would move her level with Margaret Court in the all-time list, Gauff was already being crowned as the best prospect of her generation.\nYet, as she describes poignantly, she was privately struggling to handle the pressures that so damaged Jennifer Capriati, Tracy Austin and \n. Many years after their struggles, Gauff has Bianca Andreescu and Naomi Osaka for company, but, as for all of them, hers is a journey she has to travel alone, and, as she reveals, it has been difficult.\n\u201cI\u2019ve always wondered how better or worse my life would be without tennis,\u201d she says. \u201cI found myself too busy comparing myself to others. Most of my friends go to normal high school. I felt like they always seemed so happy being \u2018normal\u2019. For a while I thought I wanted that but then I realised that, just like social media, everyone isn\u2019t as happy as what you see in their posts.\u201d\nAs the wins mounted and she rose to 49th in the world rankings \u2013 the youngest player in the WTA top 100 \u2013 Gauff observed: \u201cMy results were still OK, so this didn\u2019t have much to do with tennis. I just wasn\u2019t happy playing anyway. It is challenging to do school alone while you can\u2019t socialise with other students.\u201d\nHowever, she appreciated the upside as well. She has adapted. \u201cEven though I may miss some things, I think this lifestyle I live is perfect for me, and it\u2019s not for everyone. Travelling is never easy. I have two younger brothers and we are all really close. Every time I leave them it hurts a bit. I miss one of my brothers\u2019 birthday every year because it falls right in the middle of the French Open.\u201d\nThat won\u2019t happen this time: due to coronavirus the French Open\u2019s organisers want to move it to the end of August, just after the US Open. Gauff\u2019s home grand slam tournament is now likely to be cancelled, after the mayor of New York declared this week he could not envisage large gatherings in the city for the rest of 2020.\nGauff\u2019s tale is troublingly familiar. Capriati struggled to overcome very different problems away from the court and burned out before she got out of her teens. Injury prematurely cut down Austin and Jaeger. Gauff, Andreescu and Osaka have it all before them, good and bad.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/i-was-lost-coco-gauff-depression-tennis", "title": "'I was just lost': Coco Gauff says rapid rise and hype led to depression", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 08:00:43 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>16-year-old admits talk of her tennis ability added pressure</li><li>Gauff considered taking year off due to \u2018dark mindset\u2019</li></ul><p>\u201cI\u2019m just a kid who has some pretty big dreams\u201d is how Coco Gauff describes herself on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/cocogauff/?hl=en\" title=\"\">her Instagram handle</a>.

Normally, some would be making their racecourse debuts for their new owners in a matter of weeks.\nAmid the paralysis and uncertainty of the coronavirus lockdown, though, there will be no Breeze-Up sales in their natural slot at the outset of a fresh campaign, and perhaps 1,000 two-year-olds that have been carefully prepared for a move to a racing stable could end up as a lost generation. For anyone who has already invested significant amounts of expertise, capital and time steering these horses to the brink of a racecourse career, it is a potentially disastrous possibility.\nMany of the hundreds of juveniles that are sold at Breeze-Up sales in April and May each year, at Newmarket, Doncaster, Ascot and Deauville, are \u201cpinhooks\u201d, bought as foals or yearlings and then carefully prepared to be sold as race-ready juveniles in the spring of their two-year-old season.\nWhen a pinhooker gets it right, the profit on their initial investment can be eye-watering. Tally-Ho Stud in Ireland, for instance, bought a daughter of Kingman for 92,000gns (\u00a396,600) at Tattersalls\u2019 December yearling sale in 2018 and then sold her to Godolphin on the same spot just four months later \u2013 for 850,000gns (\u00a3892,500). But second-guessing the bloodstock market can be an expensive business too, and if a horse is unsold, much or all of their investment can be lost. What no one would ever expect, though, is for there to be no market at all.\n\u201cThere\u2019s about 1,000 horses out there waiting to be sold, and I\u2019d think about 85% of them are here in Ireland,\u201d Willie Browne, whose Mocklershill Stud operation has been pinhooking for more than 40 years, said this week.\n\u201cSo everybody\u2019s a bit down, but we\u2019re living on the hope that we can maybe get them sold. I\u2019ve got 75 horses here and it\u2019s a huge drain on finances.\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary, because nobody has a crystal ball, we don\u2019t know when the sales will be. The thing about our business is, you can maybe do racing in lockdown but we need people on the ground, unless you\u2019re going to online bidding, which would be very new in Europe. Somebody has to see these horses in the flesh.\u201d\nAustralia\u2019s prestigious Easter Yearling Sale took place online earlier this month, but at present, the 2020 Breeze-Up sales have simply been postponed. The Craven Breeze-Up is now \n, with around 150 lots catalogued, while the \n has switched to the eve of Royal Ascot in mid-June, should the meeting take place.\n\u201cA partial resumption of racing in Britain and hopefully Ireland and France as well is the key,\u201d Jimmy George, Tattersalls\u2019 chief executive, says. \u201cSales without racing are a very difficult prospect and it\u2019s hard to envisage a realistic market while racing throughout Europe is suspended. It\u2019s unsettling, and I don\u2019t think we should underestimate the impact this will have on the overall market, and on the consignors who have a lot of capital tied up in these Breeze-Up two-year-olds.\u201d\nIf an online auction is the only option, the sellers will have little choice but to take it, despite their misgivings. \u201cI don\u2019t know how it would work as I\u2019ve never bought a horse online,\u201d Roger O\u2019Callaghan, of Tally-Ho Stud, said this week. \u201cBut I know that sometimes when you see a horse walking around the ring, even though you might go in to give X, you go in and give X plus 50. You need to get a feel for it.\u201d\nFor the 2020 crop of race-ready juveniles, time is running out. \u201cThe two-year-old market is unique, in that some of those horses are precocious types and their shelf life mightn\u2019t be that long,\u201d Browne says. \u201cThose types, you\u2019d have to be worried about. If you go into July and still haven\u2019t sold, the yearlings for the next year will start selling in August. So we need to be selling in June at the very latest.\n\u201cI\u2019m at it since 1977, and I\u2019ve never come across anything like this. But listen, not getting the damn thing is most important when you\u2019re as old as I am.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/17/talking-horses-lost-generation-of-thousand-horses-in-lockdown-limbo-horse-racing", "title": "Talking Horses: 'lost generation' of thousand horses in lockdown limbo", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 23:01:20 GMT", "summary": "<p>With the Sales postponed and racing cancelled time is running out for this year\u2019s bumper crop of race-ready juveniles</p><p>This should have been the week when Newmarket, and the new Flat season, burst into life, with the Craven meeting on the Rowley Mile, Classic trials and more than 100 two-year-olds breezing on the track in the morning and then going under the hammer at the famous Tattersalls\u2019 sales ring a few hours later.

He has lived in Paris for several months, where his talent has blossomed to world elite levels.\nHis speciality is one-minute bullet chess, at which he \n on 2 April in an informal first to 100 wins match. At very fast speeds manual dexterity is important, and some blamed Carlsen\u2019s defeat on his using a mouse while Firouzja was quicker using finger touch.\nWednesday\u2019s final was at Banter Blitz, where players comment verbally on their moves during the game. The time limit was three minutes per player per game, without the one-second or two-second per move increment which is normal for three-minute blitz. Again Firouzja was noticeably faster. He won two games on time and in another Carlsen escaped by checkmating with just 0.2 seconds to spare. While Carlsen kept up an articulate running commentary throughout, Firouzja, whose English is weaker, made fewer early comments and was usually ahead on time after the opening.\nCarlsen was the heavy favourite following his impressive 9-0 semi-final win over the strong Russian Sanan Sjugirov, whereas Firouzja had struggled to defeat the Indian Srinath Narayanan 9-6. But in the final Firouzja was sharper, continually producing tactical tricks which rarely gave his opponent the classically controlled games where he dominates. If there is a historic parallel to this match, it would be the world title matches of 60-70 years ago where David Bronstein and Mikhail Tal also used their combinative ability to disrupt Mikhail Botvinnik\u2019s strategic rhythm.\nThis weekend sees the start of the $250,000 \n Invitational, the richest ever online tournament and planned as a showpiece for the world champion\u2019s skills. After the events of 2 April and this Wednesday, however, the Invitational has suddenly become a battlefield for survival for its originator.\nOne can excuse Carlsen\u2019s defeats at bullet and blitz as significantly an effect of the playing conditions and time limit which favoured Firouzja, but the Invitational has rapid time controls, 15 minutes per player per game plus a 10 seconds per move increment.\nBack in December Firouzja had Carlsen close to defeat at the World Blitz and won the silver medal behind Carlsen in the World Rapid, but next month at Wijk aan Zee at slower time limits the established elite defeated the teen. Four months further on, and Firouzja is clearly improving as fast as Bobby Fischer or Garry Kasparov did in their teenage years. So the stakes will be high at the Invitational and especially next Monday. Another success for Firouzja and much of the chess world will view him as the heir apparent to Carlsen\u2019s throne.\nFirst round pairings starting at 3pm this Saturday, are Carlsen (Norway) v Hikaru Nakamura (US) and Firouzja v Ding Liren (China), followed on Sunday by Fabiano Caruana (US) v Ian Nepomniachtchi (Russia), Maxime Vachier-Lagrave (France) v Anish Giri (Netherlands). Monday at 3pm is a time to remember as Carlsen and Firouzja meet over four rapid games.\n \n draws. If \n Qxf1+! 3 Kxf1 stalemate draw. The game ended \n Qxe2+! 3 Bxe2 stalemate draw. If 2 Kf2 Qe1+ 3 Kxf3?? (3 Kg2) loses to Qxf1 mate. Instead \n loses to 2 Kh2! Qxf1 3 Qh7+ Kg4 4 Qh4 mate.

The RFU\u2019s chief executive, Bill Sweeney, said last week he was hopeful that England could play up to seven matches this year. That remains the best-case scenario according to World Rugby, but the alternative paints a bleak picture for the RFU, which can generate around \u00a310m per home Test, with matches at Twickenham making up 85% of the union\u2019s revenue.\nOn Thursday World Rugby also announced an \u00a380m emergency fund for the unions, but while the RFU intends to take advantage of the rescue package, its share (around \u00a38m) would not cover what would be a huge shortfall if the November Tests are called off.\nAlready the RFU has implemented 25% pay cuts for its executive team, including Sweeney and the head coach, Eddie Jones, and has introduced a wage reduction scheme across the organisation. A spokesperson said: \u201cThe RFU is projecting significant losses to revenue and we welcome all support from the government and international federations to help sustain the game across England and the rest of the world.\u201d\nAs things stand England are due to tour Japan in July but it is inevitable the trip will be called off and Sweeney has already suggested they could travel to Japan in October instead. He has also mooted a \u201chome-and-away\u201d Six Nations tournament, beginning in November and concluding next spring if southern hemisphere teams are not able to travel north, either due to lockdown restrictions or the need to finish competitions such as Super Rugby and the Rugby Championship.\nWorld Rugby gave that idea its backing yesterday/on Thursday by confirming plans for a \u201ccompetition environment where cross-hemisphere travel might not be possible\u201d. If that competition does go ahead, and given England still have to finish this year\u2019s Six Nations campaign with a trip to Italy, Jones\u2019s side could be in action for weeks on end. Equally, however, England may not play again until next year\u2019s Six Nations at the earliest.\nWorld Rugby said its plans include possible provision for \u201cshort-term reshaping of the international rugby calendar [and] optimising competition opportunities for unions and domestic leagues\u201d.\nDespite the \u00a380m emergency fund, if there are no more matches at all this year it would be catastrophic for the rest of the world\u2019s unions. New Zealand have announced a 50% pay reduction for their leading players, with losses of \u00a350m forecast, while Australia are anticipating losses of \u00a360m and are close to agreeing a pay cut of around 65% with their players.\nIf matches do resume this year, they are likely to provide a blueprint for future permanent changes to the global calendar.

Both prompted muffled applause \u2013 it\u2019s hard to make much noise with gloves on \u2013 and there was a sense that the old order was prevailing. All was well with the world.\nYet after four days of uninterrupted cricket there were shocks, and the greatest one took place at Headingley (yet again). There Gloucestershire played in the top division of the championship for the first time in 15 years and they won an extraordinary match by two wickets.\nDawid Malan hit a polished 87 in his first appearance for Yorkshire and on the final day Gloucestershire were set 387 to win. There were important contributions from James Bracey and Miles Hammond \u2013 Gloucestershire always sound more threatening with a Hammond in their ranks \u2013 but the critical innings, an unbeaten 158, came from Cheteshwar Pujara on his return to Headingley.\nPujara, who had been nicknamed \u201cSteve\u201d when he played for Yorkshire, since they could not pronounce his name, was delighted. \u201cI enjoyed my time up here but I enjoyed scoring these runs as well,\u201d he said. \u201cAt Bristol they call me \u2018Cheteshwar\u2019. I prefer that.\u201d Gloucestershire\u2019s coach, the highly regarded Richard Dawson, smiled discreetly after victory on his old home turf before pointing out that there were 13 games to go.\nLancashire defeated Kent by five wickets at Old Trafford; Anderson finished with seven in the match, which means he needs another 34 to reach 1,000 in first-class cricket \u2013 584 of those have come in Test cricket. Darren Stevens, staying within the national speed limit, took five, while the younger generation was represented by Saqib Mahmood and Harry Podmore (is he the son of Dave, once of the Guardian sports pages?).\nAt Taunton there were runs in abundance in a drawn game. Bell was not the only centurion; Dom Sibley also hit a hundred, as did Matthew Wade on his debut for Somerset; and so did James Hildreth. The umpires marked the pitch as \u201cabove average\u201d, though it is doubtful the spectators agreed. No doubt the ECB were happy with it. The fourth day was a yawn; no run chase was forthcoming because the captains decided the surface was too batsman-friendly to set a target. Both sides took 11 points, which means Somerset remain at the bottom of the table on -1 after the deduction of 12 points for a poor pitch at the end of last season.\nIn the second division Middlesex played Worcestershire, who have been promoted six times in the past 17 seasons. The overseas players prevailed with Middlesex\u2019s new captain, Peter Handscomb, hitting a century, which was matched by Worcestershire\u2019s Hamish Rutherford. On a slow, true pitch it was tough for the batsmen to accelerate, though any spectator drifting into a doze was soon woken by hammering from the builders in the Compton and Edrich stands.\nThere was a more exciting game at Trent Bridge. Nottinghamshire\u2019s latest import, Haseeb Hameed, hit a century on his debut, which was matched by one from the less exalted Hassan Azad of Leicestershire. In the end the home side won with only three overs to spare, when Stuart Broad took the final wicket courtesy of a brilliant diving catch in the gully by Peter Trego, an unlikely Nottinghamshire debutant.\nAt Hove Ravi Bopara began his Sussex career with a polished 62 and Stuart Meaker snatched his first wickets for his new county. But the Durham Kolpaks, David Bedingham and Farhaan Behardien, scored vital runs and there were important wickets for Brydon Carse.\nMark Wood looked on with a broad smile from the balcony and assured everyone, as he usually does in April, that he expects to be fully fit again before long. A delighted captain, Cameron Bancroft, said he would welcome Wood\u2019s firepower for a few games before the Test series against West Indies.\nAt the venues allocated Test matches against West Indies \u2013 the Oval, Edgbaston and Lord\u2019s \u2013 there have been very promising ticket sales that suggest the game is still enjoying a boost after the excitements of 2019.\nLast time West Indies were here, they played the first floodlit Test in this country in Birmingham; this will not happen again this summer, and the number of complaints about the absence of a pink-ball Test cannot be counted on the fingers of one hand \u2013 since that number is zero. In this instance the ECB was quick to recognise a concept that does not work in this country.\nThe counties reported good crowds for the first round of championship matches, and already there are several sell-outs for the Blast.\nMeanwhile there was great excitement at the offices of the ECB as the launch of The Hundred drew nearer. A spokesperson said: \u201cEverything\u2019s going really well.

But, alas, we could not avoid it. He was the biracial Japanese-American phenom who hadn\u2019t just reached Nascar\u2019s highest rung but was being touted as the second coming of Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon \u2026 by Hall of Famer Jeff Gordon. And I am the rare black writer who covers motorsports on a national level. We have to go there.\nMy first meeting with Larson was in the winter of 2014 at a dirt-track racing extravaganza in Tulsa, Oklahoma, called \n \u2013 an event that definitely causes a chill if you happened to be one of the few non-whites attending for the first time. Larson forever struck me as a reluctant, though accommodating, trailblazer. On the one hand he has a fascinating family history: a mother whose parents were put in a Californian internment camp during the second world war. On the other hand, because of the horror of that experience and the urgency to assimilate afterward, Larson stays mum about that part of his biography.\nAs for the rest, well, it was pretty white bread. To hear him tell it, he grew up no different than many Sacramento boys did in the 90s, inhaling burgers, not speaking Japanese and worshiping at the altar of Gordon. The idea that his own Gordon-esque ascent from dirt tracks to Nascar\u2019s upper echelon would make him a role model to Asian-American fans seemed to leave him as staggered as a blown tire at 200mph. \u201cGrowing up, I didn\u2019t think anything about being Japanese, or [that] I would even have to talk about it when I got older and higher into racing,\u201d he told me back in 2014.\nAnd though he dutifully took on that responsibility \u2013 and the imprimatur of Nascar\u2019s PR-motivated \n program despite having little need for the publicity \u2013 it took people like Ryan Iwasaka, an LA-based corporate lawyer who led the effort to name Larson the Japanese Bar Association\u2019s trailblazer of the year, for Larson to appreciate the significance of his role as an agent for inclusion. The more outreach efforts increased, especially when Nascar toured on the West Coast, the more comfortable Larson seemed to be as the face of the sport that Nascar at least aspires to be. \u201cI do feel like I\u2019m making some sort of an impact,\u201d he told me last year.\nOf course all that went up in smoke on Sunday when Larson was caught calling \n, a white person, the n-word during a virtual race last weekend. Things escalated quickly. By Monday, Larson was hit with indefinite suspensions from Nascar and his team, Chip Ganassi Racing, which was in full damage-control mode as Chevrolet, McDonald\u2019s, Credit One Bank and other major sponsors distanced themselves from their radioactive racer. \n. This, after his brief social media apology tour on Monday where, among other things, Larson apologized to \u201cthe African American community\u201d and conceded \u201cthe damage is probably unrepairable\u201d.\nAll the while Larson made Nascar a trending topic for all the wrong reasons at a time when there is little else to talk about in sports. Everyone from Stephen A Smith to Charlamagne Tha God to New York Mets pitcher Marcus Stroman (\n) has registered an opinion on Larson\u2019s heel turn. That it couldn\u2019t have happened to not only a nicer guy, but also stock car racing\u2019s model minority, is a twist only the whitewashed world Nascar could offer.\nStill, let\u2019s be clear: Larson got what was coming to him. Not only is the 27-year-old far too smart for teenage gamer hate speech, but he\u2019s been in the racing game long enough to know the job doesn\u2019t stop when your entire industry moves into the virtual world. What\u2019s more, he just saw Bubba Wallace, the Cup series\u2019 resident black driver, lose sponsorship after \n in frustration. The stakes \n high, my guy.\nBut canceling him was the easy way out. It gives Nascar too much credit for champions of inclusion when, last I checked, the sport still turns a blind eye to fans \n and Maga hats and whose 40-odd car Cup grid is now down to three diversity program drivers \u2013 Wallace, Aric Almirola and Daniel Su\u00e1rez. It gives Ganassi Racing too much credit for severing ties when, last I checked, there was no Nascar racing going on and \n. (\u201cI told Kyle he can come back from this,\u201d team owner Chip Ganassi told the Associated Press. \u201cHe can even come back from this with our team.\u201d) And it gives his sponsors too much credit for seeming principled when, last I checked, none of them pressure their on-track rivals to nurture drivers who aren\u2019t white male legacy kids. Or, more globally, to pressure their corporate neighbors to make their prejudicial practices in hiring \u2013 and pay and career advancement and lending and living \u2013 a thing of the past.\nThat right there is the real privilege \u2013 the power to oppress, a power that Larson hints at with his use of the n-word but doesn\u2019t have anymore, if he ever had it all. Nascar may even have done Larson a favor by banishing him. More than any young driver Larson, who figured to be the prize of the offseason free-agent market, seemed like he could take or leave \n. When he finally did conquer the Chili Bowl earlier this year, after 13 tries he called it the biggest victory of his career, paying short shrift to his six career wins in Cup. He seemed like he would be perfectly happy racing out of the spotlight on dirt tracks and living a much smaller, much simpler life.\nCertainly, he\u2019s made enough money \u2013 an estimated $10m in 2018 alone \u2013 to make the downsize seamless. But the most disappointing part about Larson\u2019s fall from grace, the most stunning off-track crash I\u2019ve witnessed in my years on the Nascar beat, are the more odious, more bigoted elements of racing fandom coming forward to pledge their allegiance to a driver who looks for all the world like another white-passing Asian who\u2019s down for the cause.\nNo doubt Larson is the biggest loser in all this. But mark my words: he\u2019ll recover. (To paraphrase the activist filmmaker Tariq Nasheed: Traffickers of white supremacy are \n, not fired, only to return \u201crehabilitated.\u201d) Less certain is whether the progress Larson came to represent will ever get back on track.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/16/kyle-larson-fired-driver-n-word-nascar-motor-sports", "title": "Kyle Larson didn't want to go 'there' with race.

I can assure you it is much, much more important than that.\u201d It is often quoted but, at a time when the world is battling to control a virus that has taken the lives of more than 100,000, it has never been more inapt.\nHeroes at a time of lockdown are not to be found on fields, courses or empty grounds but in hospitals, care homes, supermarkets, warehouses, or behind the wheel, risking their health, and lives, for a salary that takes the best-paid footballers in Britain a morning to earn.\nWhen life returns to, not what it was, but a time when the fear of an unseen enemy has gone - which will be when a vaccine is available - sport will be one of the many businesses picking up the pieces. In rugby, unions and clubs have been hit hard financially, with Australia having to make the most drastic cutbacks.\nLaurent Marti, the president of Bordeaux-B\u00e8gles, said this week: \u201cWe have to save French rugby, 80% of a club\u2019s expenditure is player salaries.\u201d That explains a problem for clubs in England and France: as income has steadily risen over the years, the gains have tended to be reflected in the salaries of players, with clubs effectively no better off than they were 20 years ago.\nFacilities have improved, but largely through borrowing. No club has been able to build up any reserves, which is why the effect of the lockdown was felt immediately as income all but dried up. There are three main strands to a club\u2019s turnover: television, sponsorship and attendances. All three will need to be rebuilt.\nPremier League football clubs may discover that the golden eggs laid by television will contain less precious metal in future, but the medium will remain reliant on a sport that is a driver for subscriptions. A question is, how many who currently pay will stop, either because their financial circumstances have changed or because they no longer think it is worth it? As one person said this week, after recovering from the virus, what seemed important before doesn\u2019t now.\nThe sponsorship market is likely to take a hit, which will affect unions as well as clubs. Corporate packages will become a harder sell as companies cut their marketing budgets and sport becomes seen by many as a no-longer-affordable luxury. With Premiership clubs giving up 27% of their central income to CVC, in return for \u00a312.5m each last year which most used more to mop up debts than invest, the squeeze will be tight, with one forecaster predicting the \n.\nWhich leaves the supporters, loyal followers passing through the turnstiles who were largely taken for granted. How many clubs used their increased turnover to subsidise admission prices (other than for matches they were taking to bigger grounds like Twickenham or Wembley) or slow the frequency that kits changed?\nRugby will need to re-engage with paying supporters, if not to the extent of football whose lavishly paid players have \n, agreeing only to deferrals, despite recent weeks showing that football\u2019s model, where wages are generally far too high as a percentage of turnover, is unsustainable.\nThey have come up with various arguments about pay cuts, including one where the exchequer would suffer, as if none of them has ever considered a tax avoidance scheme. Unlike rugby players, who are showing realism and responsibility, they are standing apart from those who pay to watch them, heroes no more.\nSeason-ticket renewal will not be made without pause for thought. The question is not whether paying \u00a31,300 for 26 matches at the Emirates Stadium represents value for money but whether it is time to take a stand against a sport that despite massive revenue gains \u2013 Arsenal\u2019s annual turnover is \u00a3396m \u2013 demands more and more from fans: clubs now have three kits rather than two and change every season rather than every 24 months, for example.\nRugby is not there yet, but will unions still find a market for tickets priced well into three figures for international matches? The assumption seems to be that when the action resumes everything will pick up again, but one epidemiologist predicted this week that he did not see fans being able to go to sports events until a vaccine exists for coronavirus, which could be a year or more away.\nAnd, anyway, a number of supporters are likely to want to keep their distance for some time after the restrictions are lifted, with fears of a second Covid-19 outbreak. The longer they go without watching sport the greater the danger of them breaking the habit, never mind the financial question.\nThe time off gives unions and clubs the chance to look at the way they operate. It is clear to those involved in the club game that it has to break the reliance on the backing of individuals, something the CVC deal was intended to address, and start living within budget.\nIt would mean lowering the salary cap and trimming squads, ditching the Premiership Cup perhaps, and shortening the season. And considering whether the England squad should be contracted by the RFU while registered with clubs. That prospect would be anathema to owners who have invested hundreds of millions of pounds to elevate the club game, but this is a period when dreams must give way to reality.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/16/rugby-needs-to-re-engage-with-supporters-it-has-taken-for-granted-the-breakdown", "title": "The Breakdown | Rugby needs to re-engage with supporters it has taken for granted", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 09:00:02 GMT", "summary": "<p>Rugby union\u2019s revenues will need to be rebuilt and a key factor will be how clubs treat their loyal fans<br></p><p>Bill Shankly once remarked: \u201cSome people believe football is a matter of life and death.

With no TV deal, most Championship clubs are relying on matchday revenue, sponsorship and central funding from the RFL, which is split fairly evenly. With the biggest clubs attracting almost 10 times as many fans as the smallest, there is a huge disparity in finances in the division.\nBefore coronavirus swept across the world, I spoke to Championship players and coaches about the finances at their clubs and what they thought was happening elsewhere. There was an overwhelming consensus that Leigh are spending the most on player wages. The club recruited a string of established \n players last winter and everyone I canvassed \u2013 apart from the respondent from Leigh \u2013 thought they were the biggest spenders in the Championship.\nAgain, there was near consensus that Toulouse and London Broncos make up the top three. All three clubs have reportedly close to \u00a31m in recent seasons to win promotion to the Super League. There is little doubt among those in the know that Featherstone are at least fourth-highest spenders, with a wage bill believed to be over \u00a3500,000. These are the haves.\nEveryone who responded thought the two clubs promoted last year, Whitehaven and Oldham, are the lowest spenders, with Swinton, Dewsbury or Batley also near the bottom. They are the have nots.\nAcross the board, Championship clubs are gambling heavily on star players delivering the goods. Every club is investing huge proportions of their budget on a handful of players \u2013 and they need them to perform. The highest paid at each club seems to be paid almost 10% of the total playing budget. Leigh\u2019s top earner is believed to be on \u00a370,000 plus bonuses; Featherstone\u2019s gets \u00a350,000; Halifax\u2019s \u00a325,000, Dewsbury\u2019s \u00a320,000, Swinton\u2019s \u00a318,000, Batley\u2019s \u00a315,000. These players could be most at risk after the pandemic: off-loading their big salaries would give owners some breathing space.\nThe line between full-time and part-time operations is not black and white. Instead, it has more shades of grey than a Widnes skyline. Leigh have 15 full-time players; the rest of the squad have jobs. Toulouse have a similar set-up. Leigh, however, have invested in far more full-time staff than Toulouse. Featherstone have 10 players and five staff working solely for the club. The only players working full-time for Halifax also coach in the community. Everyone at Swinton, Dewsbury and Batley is part-time.\nWhether they are part-time or full-time, every player said they trained either three or four times a week. Dewsbury pack field, gym, wrestling and analysis into all three of their two-and-a-half-hour sessions each week. A full-time club who play Sunday, have Mondays off to recover and maybe take Thursday off too, will still only train on four days. The difference is their players do not arrive at training exhausted by work.\nThe Championship requires a huge commitment from part-time players. Young or fringe players are certainly not in it for the money. \u201cThere are a couple of players who may be on pay-as-you-play contracts,\u201d said a centre from a mid-table side. \u201cOur youngsters are \u2013 and they only get \u00a3200 a game.\u201d The standard appearance fee seems to be \u00a3100 plus result-based bonuses. Smaller clubs seem to pay either \u00a3200 or \u00a3250 per win. Some players at the Championship\u2019s poorest clubs are guaranteed just \u00a31,000 a year from rugby.\nYet it\u2019s clear why some experienced players choose to be a part-time star in the second tier rather than an also-ran in the Super League. Yes, Super League clubs can spend around \u00a32m a year, but with their stars on substantial six-figure salaries, that leaves plenty of lower profile players on \u00a340,000 or considerably less. With two salaries combined, a respected semi-professional player with a solid day job could be considerably better off than his peers at both work and rugby. Of course, it comes at a personal cost. Family time is scarce, social lives almost cease and you hobble into work on Monday mornings.\n\u201cMost players are on yearly contracts,\u201d explained a half-back now at his second Championship club. \u201cPersonally, I prefer to sign year-long deals as it gives me a lot more flexibility in terms of what I want to do with my life and work,\u201d a theme repeated across the division. \u201cMost players are on a salary, topped up with bonuses for appearances, winning and the number of games they play.\u201d\nWith income from matches stopped, players and coaches at almost every Championship club have been furloughed, but being on vastly lower wages than their Super League counterparts means most are still being paid in full, with their clubs topping up the government\u2019s 80% contribution. Logic suggests that with little or no revenue at the moment, clubs with wage bills of \u00a3200,000 are going to be in less trouble than those whose outgoings on players alone might be four or five times that.\nWith many clubs dependent on volunteers to operate and the majority of players having an alternative income stream \u2013 albeit via government bail-outs \u2013 smaller clubs and players may survive this lockdown rather \n.\nHerefordshire has never hosted professional rugby league but it will have a Championship 1 team when sport resumes. Hereford Harriers are newcomers to the third tier of Wheelchair Rugby League, which announced a tremendously far-reaching line-up just before the pandemic hit. Newcomers in the Wheelchair RL Super League include the rather contrasting Hull FC and Leyland Warriors, while Wales now has four teams as Celts Crusaders and Ebbw Rollers have joined the Championship. As well as traditional league strongholds, alongside Hereford in League 1 are Dundee Dragons, while Bedford Tigers and Medway\u2019s Woodlands Warriors join the might of St Helens and Wakefield Trinity in a new Development League.\nSpare a thought for French third division side R\u00e9almont XIII. Having already knocked two second-tier clubs out of France\u2019s Lord Derby Cup, the Tarn village team were due to host another \u2013 Villegailhenc-Aragon XIII \u2013 in the quarter-finals in late March. Many of R\u00e9almont\u2019s 3,000 residents \u2013 which include Toulouse Olympique coach and local farmer Sylvain Houles \u2013 were expected at Stade Claude Andr\u00e9 to see \n take on a VARL side run by former St Helens and Warrington utility man Vinnie Anderson and featuring the former Leigh centre Tyrone Pau. Let\u2019s hope R\u00e9almont still get their day in the sun. An Elite 1 opponent awaits the winners in the semi-final.\nEighty years ago, football stopped but rugby league found a way to carry on. Writing in League Express, Professor Tony Collins explained that when war broke out in September 1939, the government wanted sport to continue. So, despite many players and fans joining the armed forces \u2013 who had taken over several grounds \u2013 restricted crowd sizes, a ban on travel over 50 miles, and blackouts after dark, rugby league did.\nThe RFL cut players\u2019 wages to 10 shillings per match (\u00a333 today), leading to a strike led by Huddersfield captain Alec Fiddes. His fellow Scotsman, RFL secretary John Wilson, offered to take a pay cut. The RFL buckled and agreed to \u00a31 per player (\u00a366) with a bonus five shillings (\u00a316) for away games to \u201cfar-flung\u201d Hull and Barrow, which was somehow considered essential travel!\nBradford beat Swinton to the title and in the summer of 1940 the Ministry of Labour were so keen for the game to continue that the RFL increased payments to 25 shillings (\u00a370) per match. But by 1943 half the clubs had closed down and others were in financial strife.\nWhatever happens this time, the game will continue to be passed on through the generations. In the current issue of \n, editor Harry Edgar writes a lovely tale about former Great Britain manager Roland Davis, who, if he sees a game this season, will have watched rugby league in 10 decades. Davis saw his first game in December 1939, met original 1910 Lions tourist Billy Batten, was among the 102,000 at Odsal in 1954, and in Sydney in 1972 when Great Britain last won the Ashes. During the war he saw Wattie Davies, who won the very first Challenge Cup with Batley in 1897, signing autographs.\nSo a young child who knows Roland Davis now will be able to watch the 2097 Challenge Cup final and tell his or her grandkids that they once knew a man who had met a man who played in the very first one, 200 years earlier!\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2020/apr/16/rugby-league-clubs-super-league-lockdown-matchday-championship-wages", "title": "Why clubs below Super League may be better placed to deal with lockdown", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:00:12 GMT", "summary": "<p>Championship clubs rely heavily on matchday income but their smaller wage bills make them more nimble in a crisis</p><p>By <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gavin-willacy\">Gavin Willacy</a> for <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/nohelmetsrequiredbook\">No Helmets Required</a></p><p>Plenty has been written about <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/no-helmets-required/2020/mar/25/super-league-challenge-cup-england-coronavirus-pandemic-rugby-league\">the plight of Super League players and clubs</a>, but what is at stake in the Championship, rugby league\u2019s second tier?

Jamie Reuben, the 32-year-old son of David Reuben and nephew of Simon, is, like Staveley, scheduled to take a seat on the board, although he would first need to resign his directorship at QPR.\nAccording to the most recent Sunday Times Rich List, Reuben Brothers is controlled by the UK\u2019s second richest family, worth \u00a318.66bn, and it already has extensive property interests on Tyneside.\nAmnesty is deeply concerned about the Saudis\u2019 controlling stake and Felix Jakens, its UK head of campaigns, is fearful the coronavirus-induced economic emergency could result in the takeover receiving less scrutiny than might otherwise have been expected. \u201cWe still need to see it for what it is: Saudi Arabia attempting to use the glamour and prestige of Premier League football as a PR tool to distract from the country\u2019s abysmal human rights record,\u201d Jakens said. \u201cWith the world in crisis there\u2019s a risk this deal could go ahead without the degree of scrutiny it should receive.\n\u201cUnder the Mohammed bin Salman regime, Saudi human rights defenders have been subjected to a brutal crackdown, with numerous peaceful activists jailed \u2013 \n and other brave women\u2019s rights campaigners.\n\u201c\n over Jamal Khashoggi\u2019s grisly murder and the Saudi-led military coalition in Yemen has a disgraceful record of launching indiscriminate attacks on homes and hospitals.\u201d\nNews of Ashley\u2019s impending exit has left the majority of Newcastle fans exultant but Jakens urged supporters to examine Saudi Arabia\u2019s human rights record and question whether this buyout is really about sports-washing.\n\u201cWhile it\u2019s not for us to say who should own \n all businesses need to safeguard against any possible complicity in human rights violations,\u201d he said. \u201cFootball is no different.\n\u201cTo some degree sports-washing can be countered if interested parties are prepared to break its spell.

The suspicion remains that everyone will eventually meet halfway.\nThe players\u2019 position is that only a deferral will do and, while the Professional Footballers\u2019 Association representative, H\u00e9ctor Beller\u00edn, is the conduit for negotiations with the club, the soundings being taken generally cement this stance.\nOne agent with high-profile representation in the Arsenal first team said his position is simple: the solution has to be a deferral and, furthermore, one without caveats relating to the Champions League. Another with interest in the negotiations has the same view, saying anything other than a request for deferral with a fixed reimbursement date for the full amount should simply not be deemed acceptable from a club in the Premier League.\nUsing a player\u2019s agreed salary as \u2013 in effect \u2013 a bonus contingent on Champions League qualification was, he suggested, not an honest way to proceed, particularly given Arsenal\u2019s chances of returning to that stage for the first time in four seasons remain slim.\nThere is clearly some way to go before the situation mirrors that at Brighton, a considerable distance down the top-flight food chain, where Glenn Murray said \n details were \u201cbringing the club together even more\u201d.\nArsenal have a wage bill of around \u00a3230m, a huge figure to sustain when European football of any kind may be off the table next season, and there is an urgency to mitigate a state of affairs that \u201cputs our operating model under pressure\u201d.\nThere remains a sense in some with links to the squad that footballers who already make plenty of charitable contributions should not be taking the hit for billionaire owners.\nOne of the representatives pointed out Arsenal\u2019s academy has produced several players with first-team experience who are not yet regulars and could fetch eight-figure sums if agreements are formed now for when the transfer market grinds back into gear. That could make up a big chunk of the Covid-19 shortfall. It is an approach that has raised plenty of money before but the club see the potential for greater certainty in their current proposal.\nThe announcement on Wednesday that Arsenal\u2019s executive team \u2013 comprising the chief executive, Vinai Venkatesham, the head of football, Raul Sanllehi, the technical director, Edu and 11 others \u2013 will waive more than a third of their earnings over the next year would appear to place the ball firmly in the players\u2019 court. All the executive team are well remunerated but none earn close to a top-end Premier League salary.\nThe club also made it clear they are \u201cnot currently intending\u201d to furlough staff and nor are they considering redundancies.\nThere is no desire from any party to be caught up in a public relations battle, although the emergence over the weekend of details about such tightly guarded discussions may not have aided the players on that front, given recent sensitivities about footballers\u2019 responses to the crisis and the agreements publicly made at \u2013 for example \u2013 several Bundesliga clubs.\nIn any case, it is hard to tell where the balance of power lies. Arsenal do not want to risk alienating certain players to the extent that contract negotiations, which already look more challenging than ever, are compromised further.\nPlenty of time had been spent trying to persuade Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang to entertain the possibility of an extended stay before the Covid-19 shutdown, while the club already knew they might not have it all their own way in securing Bukayo Saka \u2013 one of \n \u2013 with Europe\u2019s giants paying attention.\nThis is no time for relations to sour and, while fists are hardly flying, a long-running saga regarding pay cuts would risk leaving Arsenal even more vulnerable.\nFor now the handsomely paid Aubameyang and Saka, who is a year from the end of his first professional deal, operate in contrasting financial stratospheres. Whether cuts or deferrals are settled on it is hard to see how any squad with such a broad pay scale can reach a one-size-fits-all agreement and a slow burn of individual negotiations looks distinctly possible.\nFirst of all, though, an amicable way out of the deadlock is required if Arsenal\u2019s prospects are not to look even more blurred.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/arsenal-players-reject-pay-cut-demand-wage-deferral", "title": "Arsenal players reject pay cut to aid club and demand wage deferral or bust", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 16:39:41 GMT", "summary": "<ul><li>Squad asked for 12.5% pay cut if Champions League not attained</li><li>Agent says solution is deferral with fixed reimbursement date </li></ul><p>The standoff between Arsenal and their players over wage reductions risks sending an untimely ripple through waters that, after a turbulent first half of the season, seemed to have calmed since Mikel Arteta\u2019s arrival in December.</p><p>Arsenal want their players to take a pay cut of 12.5%, which would apply if they did not qualify for the Champions League when football restarts, but that suggestion has been rejected by a significant number of the squad.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/arsenal-players-reject-pay-cut-demand-wage-deferral\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/f60ae7e533e466def8c3e3ce82559ceee8db2529/270_508_2929_1757/master/2929.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=9d32dd080ab6b16776af2b3c204bc6a5"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/15/dundee-u-turn-inches-celtic-closer-to-ninth-premiership-title-in-a-row": {"story": "Celtic remain on course to be declared Scotland\u2019s champions for a ninth year in succession after \n confirmed a dramatic U-turn on their crucial vote to abandon the season.

There\u2019s a bumper weekend of retro entertainment ahead, including the original Super Sunday and the greatest of all Super Sundays.

The phrase \u201cSuper Sunday\u201d became part of the football lexicon two years later, when it fell out of Richard Keys\u2019 abundant mouth before \n. On Sunday afternoon they are repeating Nottingham Forest 1-0 Liverpool in its entirety, though sadly they have stopped short of replaying the full five-hour broadcast: two hours of build-up and another hour after the game. Sky are also repeating a documentary about Arsenal\u2019s Invincible season on Sunday night. Just before that, BT Sport have highlights of Arsenal\u2019s swaggering victories over Juventus and Bayer Leverkusen in 2001-02, and the hammering of Internazionale two seasons later. Look, it doesn\u2019t matter whether they went on to win Big Cup in those seasons. Don\u2019t be a buzzkill. Just live in the moment almost 20 years ago!\nFinally, and yes we know it\u2019s not football but our cricketing cousin, The Spin, keeps badgering us to mention it, BT are showing the magnificent Forged In Fire from 9pm on Sunday. Wait, come back! It\u2019s a three-part documentary about the modern history of Ashes cricket, full of candid, fruity interviews. Take this example from human moustache Merv Hughes on how Allan Border turned the Australian team round from the dark days of the mid-1980s. \u201cAB just stood up and said: \u2018Right, I\u2019m sick of being seen as nice guys and getting beaten everywhere we go \u2013 I\u2019d rather win games and be seen as a pr1ck.\u2019\u201d \n\u201cSuited me down to the ground!

It sticks in the memory for two reasons: an Oxford fan was thrown out for chanting during the pre-match minute\u2019s silence to respect the death of the Queen Mother; and in the week prior to the game, York\u2019s owner (and \n John Batchelor) had been refused permission by the FA to play \u2013 during the game \u2013 a recording of fans singing to boost the atmosphere. A crowd of 3,290 watched \n in near silence, save for the away fans singing: \u2018Can you hear the Tannoy sing? No-oo, no-oo\u2019\u201d \u2013 Howard Roberts.\n\u201cA reporter was doing a live segment from Roberto Di Matteo\u2019s King\u2019s Road restaurant where he, Dennis Wise, Dan Petrescu, Gus Poyet and others were eating. He asked Gustavo how he was settling in; he replied he was enjoying himself in the dressing room and Wise was helping him with his English and had even taught him a song. The reporter could not resist asking, so the TV audience got to hear Gustavo\u2019s innocent rendition of \u2018Who the Eff are Man United\u2019 while Wise fell off his chair laughing. Oddly, Sky have never repeated that interview\u201d \u2013 Dave Newsome.\n\u201cMy favourite game in defeat (Fiver letters passim) was undoubtedly Leicester 3-4 Swindon in the 1993 play-off final at old Wembley. Up against player-manager Glenn Hoddle, we were 3-0 down after an hour, destined for humiliating defeat, before roaring back with three goals in 10 minutes \u2013 literally roaring when the third went in, it still gives me shivers and that feeling has never quite been repeated since (despite all that Premier League stuff in 2016). Of course, we then went on to lose to a late, dodgy penalty but it had changed from humiliating to glorious defeat, so we all went to Covent Garden and met loads of other fans in the Dutch pub for an impromptu massive party on Sunday night in London\u201d \u2013 Jim Smith.\n\u201cCan I just point out to Mike Fichtner (yesterday\u2019s letters) that Neither Rochester nor Syracuse are anywhere near I-95 (which connects Boston, New York and beyond).

From my back bedroom in Latchford, \n, just beyond a railway embankment, towered the tatty, powder-blue corrugated iron of Wilderspool. It was the first thing my eye would be drawn to when the curtains opened; on matchdays, roars and awws pipped the local radio in relaying how things were going.\nShortly before I attended my first game, aged 10, came Warrington\u2019s own Sex Pistols at The Lesser Free Trade Hall \u2013 a Stones Bitter Championship game hundreds have spent the past 32 years pretending they were at. The Wire\u2019s coach, Tony Barrow, later dubbed the rain-sodden New Year\u2019s Day 1988 game \u201cWorld War Three\u201d.\nThe ball had barely landed in Warrington\u2019s half from kick-off when the first punches were thrown, Wigan\u2019s Kiwi prop Adrian Shelford swinging at Brian Johnson as the Australian full-back went down in the opening tackle. By the second tackle Johnson\u2019s compatriot Les Boyd was seeking Shelford out with his left jab. The game was 12 seconds old. Most heavyweight boxing bouts go deeper before seeing any arm movements of note.\nBoyd was gloriously talented, a member of his country\u2019s Invincibles side in 1982, but a noted shaman of shithousery \u2013 \n. Though the match was already bad-tempered, eight minutes in he stepped things up.\nTaking a forward pass yards from Wigan\u2019s line, Boyd simultaneously cocked his right fist towards Andy Gregory. A shirt-tweak from Kevin Iro was seemingly his final straw, grounds for warfare so thin even Tony Blair might admire the audacity. Gregory \u2013 a diminutive former Warrington player \u2013 merrily windmilled back. \n, with Shelford and Warrington\u2019s Tony Humphries eventually sent off, and Boyd sent to the sin-bin.\nTen minutes later Andy Goodway was sent off for a flying forearm smash to the back of Paul Cullen\u2019s head, leaving the Wire centre face-down in the dirt. And off he trotted, straight over Cullen\u2019s fingers. Adrenalised, the Warrington man leapt to his feet and clattered his attacker to the ground from behind, just in front of the dugouts. It took almost half of the Warrington team to drag Goodway clear of the melee.\nFrom there 11 v 11 pandemonium, plus one outstanding try. Ellery Hanley sold two dummies in midfield to open a path to the right wing, with only Johnson to beat. The Warrington man was carried along for the final 20 metres to the corner in an almost Lomu-esque display of pace and power: 4-0 Wigan.\nBoyd broke to set up his side\u2019s reply, offloading a (forward) pass to Billy McGinty, who bounced over. Try given. Boyd again sent Wire away for their second, dived in by Johnson. Two Woods conversions and a drop-goal made it 13-4 at half-time.\nAfter the interval Gregory came to the fore, skying a kick into the left corner where Steve Hampson leapt over Des Drummond to touch down. Iro converted. Hanley was then released by Gregory to skip through on the right: 13-14 Wigan.\nA Woods penalty regained the lead, but the closing moments were all Wigan\u2019s. In the shadow of the posts, with two minutes remaining, Gregory stabbed over a drop goal to level at 15-15.\nThere would be no winning score but few went home disappointed. Except perhaps Cullen, who spoke with the Great Britain coach Mal Reilly soon after: \u201cWhatever international prospects I had at that time finished there and then.\u201d He would, however, later coach his club.\nHanley ultimately replaced Reilly in the GB role, with Goodway following in 1997. Johnson succumbed to Alzheimer\u2019s disease in 2016 aged 59, while Shelford, who sustained a career-ending knee injury at 27, died aged 39 following a heart attack.\nAfter the hooter, a parka-clad lad darted for halfway with a foolscap pad and a pen, hunting for autographs. He looked the sort of age I was at the time. I hope he still has them.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/15/my-favourite-game-warrington-v-wigan-1988-rugby-league", "title": "My favourite game: Warrington v Wigan, New Year\u2019s Day 1988 | Stuart Goodwin", "published": "Wed, 15 Apr 2020 11:00:44 GMT", "summary": "<p>The brutality and foul play began from the first tackle, went downhill from there and the match ended up 11 v 11<br></p><p>I\u2019ve always felt sorry for anyone who\u2019s never lived in sight of a stadium.

On 4 March 2018, reacting to the news that barrier-busting miler Roger Bannister had died, Mike Selvey \u2013 the long-term lord of this manor \u2013 posted the following: \u201cThe great John Walker ran a sub-four-minute mile on a track laid out on the outfield of the MCG during the Centenary Test in March 1977.\u201d\nHold up. He did what? During the most fondly recalled Test ever staged at the G?\nWhen Google turned up nothing, my interest was piqued. I pledged to Selvey \u2013 a member of that England touring squad and a trifle unlucky to miss selection after an impressive showing in the warm-up game \u2013 that I would get to the bottom of it. Well, that was more than two years ago. As is often the case current events overtook but with no such excuse anymore I went digging.\nAs context for those less familiar with the events of that week the occasion would still have been remarkable. Before the Test was played Wisden already declared it would be the \u201cgreatest event in cricket history\u201d. Of the 244 living Ashes players invited to Melbourne, all but 26 made it. Jack Ryder, at 87, was the oldest Australian, dying three weeks later. His opponent from 1920-21, Percy Fender, led 79 Englishmen off their flight, the 84-year-old in a wheelchair.\nThe tale of the match turned out to be just as momentous, the touchstones of it requiring little further explanation: Lillee, Marsh, Willis, Hookes, Greig, McCosker, Randall, the collapses, the chase\u2026 the Queen! Oh, and that the margin was \n \u2013 spookily, just as it was in the inaugural fixture they were marking from exactly 100 years before.\nBut let\u2019s zero in on the third day \u2013 the one that opened the door to this Test evolving into a classic after a pair of first-innings collapses. It was on that third afternoon when the 21-year-old debutant David Hookes brashly drove and pulled the England captain Tony Greig\u2019s off-spin to the rope five times in a row. Later, Rick McCosker emerged with a mummified face after Bob Willis broke his jaw the first time around. My dad, in attendance as a 15-year-old, remembers the crowd singing \u201cWaltzing McCosker\u201d as he continued hooking safely through to stumps. As he\u2019s relayed to me many times \u2013 employing an old MCG trope \u2013 55,399 were in the stands for this memorable day in Australian Test history but \u201chalf a million say they were\u201d. \nBefore lunch, Walker \u2013 an Olympic champion nine months earlier \u2013 changed into his famous all-black running kit. At this point Selvey recalls catching his first glimpse of the mighty New Zealander\u2019s distinctive long blond hair and thick thighs. Having won gold in the 1500m at the 1976 Montreal Olympics he was a superstar in the tradition of Trans-Tasman middle-distance giants of the previous quarter-century, from Herb Elliott and Peter Snell to Ron Clarke and John Landy. \nBut when Walker emerged for the start of the Centenary Mile, as it was billed, it would not be alongside the man he expected \u2013 Australia\u2019s best at the distance, Graham Crouch. The \u201clittle Australian\u201d, as he was described on commentary during the frenetic 1974 Commonwealth Games 1500m, was also in the placings when the Kiwi became the first man to break 3:50 for the mile in 1975 and then trailed Walker in his successful Olympic final in 1976. He elected to sit out the race, watching from the stands. Ken Hall, the national champion from only three days earlier, did likewise, citing exhaustion.\nThe field of four Walker had left were, The Age described, \u201cwilling but weak\u201d by comparison. Combined with blustery conditions and a grass track, the organisers\u2019 hopes of a sub-four-minute time were dashed. The champion sat back before going to work in the final 300m, newspaper reports saying he bolted in by 30m in 4:05.\nMemories of Walker\u2019s storming finish, with a final lap of 54sec, tallies with the recollection of Jim Maxwell \u2013 26 at the time \u2013 who then had just called his first of more than 300 Tests the month before. He made the trip partly to work but mostly to socialise, as he did with John Arlott and Alan McGilvray, the man from whom Maxwell would later inherit the tag as the voice of Australian cricket. \u201cWhen you saw him you had to stop,\u201d he recalls of the race. \u201cYou didn\u2019t turn your head. You just watched because he was a very attractive athlete.\u201d\nWalker\u2019s disappointment in his rival Crouch was unmistakable, calling it a \u201cvery bad show\u201d from the local lad. \u201cGraham is supposed to be the best runner in Australia,\u201d he said. \u201cThe crowd expected him to run and he should have run.\u201d But Dr Larkins\u2019 perspective is that this was simply reflective of their competitive relationship. For taking part in the race, they all received a brass wine goblet in which Larkins keeps his pens at home to this day.\n\u201cIt always surprises people when I say the biggest crowd that I ran in front of was not at the Olympics but at the MCG during the cricket! And I have very fond memories of John. He was \n track star.\u201d\nAfter finding out all there was on the public record and talking to those who remembered it Walker (Sir John, since 2009) kindly agreed to talk to The Spin from his home in Auckland. He might have slowed down over the past two decades owing to Parkinson\u2019s disease but it has not lessened his broader contribution, a decade as a local government councillor only ending last October on retiring at 67.\n\u201cYou are the first person to bring it up with me for over 40 years,\u201d Walker began. He was understandably reluctant to reflect on what happened that day with his old sparring partner Crouch, who died from cancer last year, instead focusing on the honour of performing in front of packed grandstands.\n\u201cI remember going down the back straight being a fair way behind and realising that if I didn\u2019t get into gear I wasn\u2019t going to catch them. So, I took off and won quite easily in the end. Thank you for bringing it up.\u201d\nWalker would not top his 1976 triumph, thwarted by injury and then a boycott, which denied him a chance to defend his Olympic crown in 1980. He never stopped running the mile, becoming the first to break four minutes on 100 occasions in 1985 and going on to do so 135 times.\nAs for Selvey he is pleased his affinity with New Zealand and running did not collude to trick him into believing something that wasn\u2019t. \u201cI thought it might have been something I wanted to have happened,\u201d he says. \u201cThere didn\u2019t seem to be any recollection from anyone.\u201d Well, there is now.\nSigning off from the telecast, Frank Tyson described the Centenary Test as \u201cthe Olympic Games of cricket\u201d. What\u2019s irrefutable is that Olympic spirit did return to a cricket ground that magnificent week, through one of the greatest of them all.\n \n.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2020/apr/14/when-john-walker-ran-the-forgotten-mile-at-1977-centenary-test-cricket", "title": "The Spin | When John Walker ran the forgotten mile at 1977's Centenary Test", "published": "Tue, 14 Apr 2020 09:45:16 GMT", "summary": "<p>Everyone remembers the cricket but few recall the day John Walker took to the track in Melbourne</p><p>It started with a tweet.

Additionally, Victor Valdes, Joan Capdevila, \u00c1lvaro Arbeloa and Ra\u00fal Albiol featured, who were in the squad but did not play in the final.

Dan Almond adds the name of Terry Venables, who played for and managed QPR, Spurs, Crystal Palace Palace and England.\nBut the winner may well be Dermot Keely who played for and managed Home Farm, Dundalk, UCD, Shamrock Rovers and Sligo Rovers \u2013 as noted by Sean DeLoughrey.\nAnd this week\u2019s quirk-inclusion goes to John Gregory, who as well as having played for and managed Aston Villa, QPR and Derby County, was also appointed as manager of Plymouth in 1990, but only lasted two games. His replacement, David Kemp, immediately selected him as a player and he made three appearances. So, as well as managing three clubs he formerly played for, he also played for a club he formerly managed. Thanks to Pete Moxon for that.\n \n.\nWe had a few nominations for the longest daily to trip to training, including Winston Bogarde (Amsterdam-Chelsea: 356km) and Wolfsburg\u2019s Pablo Thiam (Berlin-Wolfsburg: 150km), but no one got near the monster commute, albeit not a daily one, undertaken by the Australian striker \n.\n\u201cMori, playing at the time in the A-League for Central Coast Mariners, still lived in Adelaide,\u201d explained Andrew Stockings. \u201cBefore that he was playing for Perth Glory, when he also commuted between matches from Adelaide.

His passion was the art of driving and it absolutely made him one of the greats. He drove using his instincts and while the facts may say he never won a world championship, in terms of the legendary names in the sport he is up there with the best, with Jim Clark and Juan Manuel Fangio, with Jackie Stewart and Lewis Hamilton.\nMoreover Stirling will also always be remembered as a true sportsman. He had very strong views on what was right and wrong in terms of how you conduct yourself both on and off the track. In that way he was a throwback to an era when the ideas of being generous in defeat, chivalrous and wanting to win fair and square were commonplace.\nI came to know him through my career, although I have no memory of the very first time we met, when Stirling came to my christening. My dad, Graham Hill, managed to persuade him to come and he was there with Bruce McLaren, Taffy von Tripps, Tony Brooks and the whole gang.\nWe share the same birthday, and after I became an F1 driver our paths would often cross. As part of the British Racing Drivers\u2019 Club he was very, very supportive of the work we were doing there. To say someone is a living legend is an overused phrase, but he really was. He could regale us with tales of racing in the good old, bad old days when it was absolutely lethal.\nDuring my career, I was very much aware of his weighty comments, his opinions of my own performance. A name like Stirling even commenting on what you are doing is nearly always good, unless of course he didn\u2019t think I had been very impressive. Being Stirling, he was not afraid to give his opinion. He was very forthright, informed by his career and very pithy, but never unnecessarily negative and always a lovely guy, really great company.\nAs time went on I got to know him even better through the Goodwood Festival of Speed, the \n, the BRDC and even \n. I was once given the job of looking after Stirling, getting him up and down the stairs at Sports Personality and he was still as feisty as ever, even when he was a bit wobbly on his pins.\nIt illustrated his determination, his commitment to throwing himself into life just as he had to competing. He dedicated himself 100% to being a racing driver, he was not a dilettante or part-timer. He was a full-on serious, professional racing driver. Stirling was one of the first people in motor racing to become highly in demand, and he managed his own affairs and his business. He was the first real megastar driver from this country and he created the model for everyone that came after him. Stirling ignited interest in others who went on to become world champions. Indeed, all racing drivers have a lot to thank Stirling for because he made driving a career.\nAfter his accident at Goodwood in 1962, when he found he could no longer drive on instinct, Stirling was honest in calling it a day. That epitomised his attitude to racing. He would rather not have driven than to lack that sense of being at one with the car and being out there on the very edge.\nIn that way he was very like \n and a lot of the greats. A seat-of-the-pants driver, attuned to his senses who managed to deal with the fear, to intellectually put it to one side. But he was also smart enough to realise that once that magic had gone he shouldn\u2019t be doing it any more.\nDuring his time on the track he of course became a darling of the British public, through his performances as a driver, and as a winner. He gave Britain what they wanted, he symbolised hope for the future in a dashing personality. He went on to burnish that image of a British sporting gent, and even after he retired he was very good at giving people the racing driver that they wanted. Stirling always delivered the legend.\nThere is great sadness at his death, but a quote of Stirling\u2019s I enjoy from a book written about him back in 1963 still touches me today: \u201cI took a very great deal out of motor racing but I put a lot back too, I do feel that I gave it all but my life.\u201d\nStirling was at heart a motor racing aficionado, a lover of the sport and a lover of driving.\n \n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/apr/12/stirling-moss-great-racing-driver-formula-one-ayrton-senna", "title": "Stirling Moss was like Ayrton Senna: a lover of motor racing who gave his all | Damon Hill", "published": "Sun, 12 Apr 2020 20:00:52 GMT", "summary": "<p>The first British megastar driver, who set the model for those who followed, was a true sportsman and always great company</p><p>I still like to remember Stirling Moss considering the nature of his craft. \u201cSpeed is tranquillity,\u201d he said, and that summed up his approach.

A club that do not have contracts with their players and whose priority is the organisation and everyone involved in it rather than the first team stood alone the last time they were first promoted to English rugby\u2019s second tier three years ago. But their model is set to be copied by others as the financial impact of the coronavirus lockdown deepens.\n\u201cThe finances of the Championship simply don\u2019t work,\u201d says Steve Hill, Richmond\u2019s director of rugby for the past 10 years and first-team head coach. \u201cWith the cuts to it that will be made by the Rugby Football Union, more clubs will have to look at our model. Outside Ealing Trailfinders, who have a wealthy backer, virtually all are losing money and it cannot continue. You do not want clubs going out of existence but we are in danger of that happening as things stand.\u201d\nRichmond\u2019s two-season fling in the Premiership ended in 1999 when their backer pulled out and they dropped to the bottom of the league pyramid. They are trading places with Yorkshire Carnegie, who survived last season at the expense of the south-west London club after parachuting in players to help them to avoid relegation. Yorkshire controversially retained their status after agreeing a company voluntary agreement with creditors, having piled up debts of more than \u00a3500,000. This season Yorkshire have lost all 14 league games, are set to leave Headingley and are reverting back to being called Leeds.\n\u201cI suppose it made our promotion doubly sweet,\u201d Hill says. \u201cThe RFU told us Carnegie were going to be very competitive this season. We knew that would not be the case, but 12 months on we really enjoyed our season in National Division One, a cracking, incredibly competitive competition. We were not the favourites to win it, with some clubs paying a lot more than our match fees . The highest payers hit trouble and lost players, reinforcing my belief that rugby beneath the Premiership needs to be reset.\n\u201cMore teams will have to become part-time. There is no other way if rugby is to become financially sustainable. All sports will have to consider how and where money is spent. If rugby goes back to the days when clubs invested in facilities, coaching and creating a really good social atmosphere, that will attract players because they will not be able to do so by offering money. Some of the amounts being offered at level four and below are ridiculous: a lot of that will now have to disappear, which will be a good thing.\u201d\nLike all clubs, Richmond have had to make adjustments as income all but stops but they have not had to furlough players who hold full-time jobs in spheres ranging from teaching and recruitment to carpentry and sourcing film locations for production companies. \u201cWe pay a match fee and it is the same whether you have played 150 matches for the club or are making your debut,\u201d Hill says.\n\u201cThere are no contract negotiations and no one talks about money when they are having a meal after a game. They have proper conversations and I do not envy rugby directors who have to pick certain players because they are on big money. I can say to any new player that if they are good enough, they will be in the team; it is a powerful recruitment tool and I would struggle to explain to someone why another player was worth twice as much as him. \u201d\nNext season, Richmond will play Saracens for the first time in 21 years, \n against the unsalaried. \u201cIt will be amazing,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIt is the first question everyone asks me. There will be no pressure on us. When Bristol were last in the Championship, we were level 24-24 with them at half\u2011time at home. Pat Lam [the Bears\u2019 director of rugby] was going ballistic in the stand. They pulled away in the second half but we showed we can compete and in our three seasons in the Championship, Bristol and London Irish were the only clubs we did not beat.\n\u201cI do not know how many of Saracens\u2019 superstars will face us but anyone who plays for them is outstanding: their academy is second to none. It will be a fantastic occasion and we are looking forward to the away games at Cornish Pirates and Jersey, great weekends. We will stay over in Jersey and have a night out. We are not going to change as a club because we are in the Championship: ethos, environment and spirit are far more important than where your first team play.\u201d\nThe lockdown means Hill cannot do any recruitment. \u201cI like to meet someone face-to-face and see the whites of their eyes. What they are like as a person is more important than how good they are as a player.

Friday 20 March to be precise \u2013 the day it was announced all cafes, pubs and restaurants had to shut because of coronavirus and everyone in the country realised they were in for many, \n nights stuck in front of the television.\nSo began the search for things to watch and for football lovers quick relief came on that first Saturday when Channel Four showed \n, the critically acclaimed documentary by director Asif Kapadia. I\u2019d seen it at a screening in central London 10 months earlier and found myself nodding in agreement as praise for the film filled social media. Kapadia witnessed the outpouring too and even for a man who has been there, done that and got the Oscar, there was satisfaction to be taken from the way his work was being received.\n\u201cLooking at Twitter from my sofa it felt like a lot of people were watching the film, and a lot of people I respect. So that was a great feeling,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was actually a complete coincidence Channel Four showed the film on the first Saturday after the pubs shut, and as ever I was one of the last people to find out.\u201d\nKapadia delivers that last line with a laugh, which is in keeping with his mood as we speak \u2013 like many are doing right now \u2013 via WhatsApp.\nThese are strange times but the 47-year-old is coping well, partly because he is used to working from home and partly because of the sense of perspective he is able to maintain while in isolation with his wife and two children. \u201cWe have a home, food, hot water and a garden,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cCompared to a lot of people we\u2019re lucky.\u201d\nHis frustration is instead directed towards the government, which will come as no surprise to anyone who \n. He is politically outspoken and does not hold back when assessing how the current crisis is being managed. \u201cI\u2019ve felt for years that the Tories have not looked after the NHS, not properly funded it, and nothing they are doing right now has changed my mind. I hope people remember this the next time they vote.\u201d\nThis is a theme Kapadia will touch on again later but for now our conversation shifts back to Diego Maradona, the director\u2019s seventh feature film and third documentary following Senna, which focuses on the life and death of Formula One legend Ayrton Senna, and Amy, which tells the tragic story of singer Amy Winehouse and for which Kapadia \n.\nFor Maradona he deployed the same archive techniques and again produced something brilliant. \n centred on the seven years Maradona spent at Napoli, a period that took in two World Cups and during which the Argentinian\u2019s myth and legend \u2013 for better and worse \u2013 was established. It is all there in the film, starting with a sequence showing cars hurtling through the streets of Naples en route to Maradona\u2019s unveiling at the Stadio San Paolo in July 1984 that is as thrilling as it is apt.\n\u201cWith Maradona you have this guy who is God or the devil depending on your opinion. He\u2019s not in the middle, he\u2019s extreme, and people like that cannot help but be interesting,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cThe point of the film is to say \u2018just watch him\u2019, and even if you hate him you can\u2019t deny he was amazing.\n\u201cI love the opening sequence \u2013 it\u2019s the very essence of Maradona\u2019s life. One of my other favourite scenes is the one of him at Napoli\u2019s Christmas party, after the [1990] World Cup. No one talks to him and he doesn\u2019t talk to anyone, the shot holds for ages and you just know he\u2019s going through a lot. It\u2019s really powerful.\u201d\nKapadia spent nine hours interviewing Maradona before making the documentary, speaking with him at his home in Dubai and elsewhere. The experience allowed him to develop an unusually rounded view of someone who, post-retirement, has taken on a rather grotesque persona.\n\u201cIt\u2019s rare you have direct access to someone like Maradona \u2013 you\u2019re always going via other people. So you get annoyed with the guy but it\u2019s the entourage who play a big part in how he comes across,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cIn the time I spent with Maradona I got to see he has good days and bad days, like most people.\u201d\nAnd has he seen the film? \u201cAnyone else, if there was a film about them you know they would have by now, but this being Maradona, he\u2019s decided he\u2019s not going to watch it,\u201d Kapadia replies with another laugh. \u201cI think he probably has.\u201d\nThe son of Indian immigrants, Kapadia was born and raised in Hackney, east London. He found his calling in the visual arts in his early 20s. It was perhaps inevitable he would make a film about football given one of his earliest memories is watching the \n on television.\nKapadia also played football as a child and, during that time, developed a love for a club that endures to this day. \u201cI come from a family of Arsenal fans and for my first game, my brother took me to Highbury to watch Arsenal versus Liverpool,\u201d he says. \u201cI was with the Arsenal fans and Arsenal won but I felt nothing for them \u2013 it was all about \n.\n\u201cI supported them because my best mate did. Neither of us even knew where Liverpool was but it was the 1970s and back then we weren\u2019t even allowed out of our road.\u201d\nThis leads to a discussion about the incredible season Liverpool were experiencing and to the man who has brought joy and hope back to the supporters \u2013 \n. \u201cI love him,\u201d Kapadia says. \u201cHe is honest, passionate and genuinely cares. Whenever I hear him speak I think: \u2018Why can\u2019t we have politicians like that?\u2019\u201d\n\u201cI have a theory on Klopp,\u201d Kapadia continues. \u201cI think he\u2019s a man of faith. I know from my own background that believing in God doesn\u2019t have to be an awful thing \u2013 it can be really interesting and get you through difficult times, and I see that in J\u00fcrgen.\n\u201cTo stress \u2013 I don\u2019t know this for sure. But it would explain how he has lost as many finals as he has and never whinged, or how he is able to see the bigger picture right now. Honestly, if J\u00fcrgen turned around and said: \u2018I don\u2019t care about the league, there\u2019s more important things to worry about,\u2019 I\u2019d follow him.\u201d\nAll of which begs an obvious question \u2013 would Kapadia ever consider making a film about Liverpool, and Klopp in particular? \u201cI like having Liverpool as my hobby and when your hobby becomes work it can be difficult,\u201d he replies.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s for sure is one day, when he\u2019s won 15 trophies for us and retired, I\u2019d love to sit down with Klopp. He\u2019s complex, has had a really interesting journey, and is incredibly charismatic. I\u2019d love to dig into his brain.\u201d\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/2020/apr/14/asif-kapadia-jurgen-klopp-is-honest-passionate-and-cares-i-love-him", "title": "Asif Kapadia: 'J\u00fcrgen Klopp is honest, passionate and cares.

As the \n wondered what the future held for its new sporting star, nobody could have imagined it would see her homeless, then in jail, before she picked up the pieces of her life in the pornography industry.\nPride was an alien sensation to Van de Leur when she was competing. In her new autobiography, \n, she claims her parents put success over her wellbeing, pressuring her to succeed for their own gain. When she failed to finish on the podium, her mother would refuse to pick her up from the airport, forcing her to take long train rides home in tears.\nIn the gym, she alleges the training techniques of her coach, Frank Louter, were physically and mentally abusive. While gymnasts were forced to practise too many routines with too many injuries, she says, staff members rummaged through their bags and shamed them for the snacks they hid in lieu of proper meals.\n\u201cIt\u2019s like in the circus with the animals,\u201d she says of the coaching methods in a phone interview. \u201cIt\u2019s doing it the hard way. That\u2019s how you learn. You see the documentaries on the internet with crying kids? That\u2019s how it went with us too. If you want to be flexible, it\u2019s hurting. That\u2019s with weight training, that\u2019s with conditioning, that\u2019s with the tricks. Sometimes you break something, sometimes not and you\u2019re lucky.\u201d\nVan de Leur was not lucky. By 2003, aged 17, her body was crumbling and her mind was vacant. Burnt out a year after her biggest successes, she found herself thinking about suicide. \u201cI felt as if I was in a black hole,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe the best thing was to quit but there was no option to quit. I tried it a few times but nobody let me.\u201d\nIt would take another five years before Van de Leur found the nerve to relieve herself from that suffocating environment. What she did not expect on her retirement in 2008 was that parting from the sport would lead to a permanent familial rupture.\nAfter she began to explore the world beyond the confines of her gym with her boyfriend, Robbie, she returned home one day to find the locks had been changed and she was no longer allowed to enter the building. She later investigated her prior earnings and learned her father had spent her money on his own personal leisure. She eventually won two lawsuits against him, the judge forcing him to pay back a total of \u20ac62,000 (around \u00a355,000).\nVan de Leur and her boyfriend were homeless for two years, sleeping in a car every night. Survival meant long afternoons collecting a few cents on the beach, eating complimentary food in supermarkets. Sometimes they would shoplift. Before helping with youth camps at gyms, she would douse herself in sample supermarket perfume. Although there was a romantic aspect to Van de Leur\u2019s life in those days, finally free with her partner against the world, it was always tempered by the cold reality.\n\u201cWhen you have no food and have to shoplift, it\u2019s crossing a line, crossing your own borders that you never thought you would do,\u201d she says. \u201cBut to survive, you would do anything that you need.\u201d\nTheir time in the wilderness and out of view ended abruptly. Van de Leur was wandering around a park one day in 2010 when she noticed a man and woman having an affair. She took photos of the pair and then confronted the woman, eventually demanding \u20ac2,000. \u201cI was really in the lowest state you can think of,\u201d she says. \u201cOn the street with really nothing and when this happened, she asked me if I wanted money. I said, quick-thinking: \u2018Yes.\u2019 Because I needed it.\u201d\nOne night a few weeks later she was arrested by a large group of police. Initially detained for 72 days, Van de Leur was charged with blackmail and then also possession of child pornography after photos were allegedly found on a folder in her laptop. The latter charge fell apart in court after her lawyer argued several people had access to her computer.\nThe damage was done. A day before her trial, the press published details of the case and she watched every organisation she had links to sever ties, her life crumbling again before her eyes. \u201cWithin 24 hours everything was cancelled,\u201d she said. \u201cThen you have to start over. But it\u2019s hard to actually start over if society doesn\u2019t accept you.\u201d\nIn 2011 as she was figuring out the rest of her life, she was offered a contract to do webcam pornography videos. Van de Leur says she probably would not have agreed had her financial and professional earnings not been so damaged by the court case.\n\u201cIt took me a couple of weeks to think about because this one was for the public. So I talked with my boyfriend about the decision and he said: \u2018Whatever you feel,\u2019 because I\u2019m the one sitting there and they are going to use my name \u2026 It was such a huge amount [of money]. For me, it was an opportunity to make something from my life, to build something.\u201d\nAfter her step into the adult entertainment world, she decided to create her own company and website, participating in adult films while hiring other models for pornographic movies. In a torrid industry, she resolved to film only with her boyfriend, to choose every bit of work for herself and to pull the plug whenever she felt uncomfortable. Her job required her also to chat daily with fans.\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to explain because sometimes you don\u2019t know their face, their name, and for others you know everything. You know their wife\u2019s name, their children, where they work, where they live. Depending on how much the fan wants to share.\u201d\nAs a gymnast her life was entirely dictated by the whims of the surrounding adults but she saw this as an opportunity to make money and be autonomous through the company she founded and the people she interacted with.\nAt the end of 2019, she stepped away from the adult film business. Now 34, her gaze has shifted, altered by the Me Too movement \n and bringing to light the working conditions of gymnasts.\n\u201cEvery time you hear something, there\u2019s still a new case or someone who doesn\u2019t speak up,\u201d she says. \u201cWhenever it\u2019s possible, I\u2019m working with [sports] federations, what they can do better to make the environment just a little safer for the kids \u2026 If I can be a person [they trust] and they want to talk to me, that\u2019s the thing that I want to do.

On the evening of Sunday 15 March, I and many others teaching at universities and drama schools were looking ahead to a week of lessons and wondering how to socially distance on the commute. By Monday afternoon, the shutters were coming down at \n across the country. Learning was suddenly a remote activity.\nUniversities and drama schools are now closed for the rest of the academic year, with teaching and assessment having shifted online. It\u2019s a challenge for everyone, but especially for those subjects \u2013 like theatre \u2013 that usually rely on physical presence and contact. Just as theatres and artists are exploring ways to share their work digitally, teachers are suddenly forced to reimagine their courses for the online environment.\nDrama schools have a particularly tough task. As Lamda\u2019s director \n stresses, it\u2019s important to recognise that some aspects of actor training need to happen in a live space. \u201cThere is no point us pretending that we could do everything online,\u201d she says, adding that the school has thought carefully about which elements of its teaching can be delivered digitally.\nShe is echoed by Edward Kemp, director of Rada, who says: \u201cWe know we won\u2019t be able to recreate an identical experience to face-to-face teaching.\u201d Similarly, Guildhall School has taken the decision to defer some teaching until the autumn, when they hope that they can return to face-to-face learning.\nSchools are trying to respond creatively to the pandemic. First-year acting students at Guildhall are devising a piece of online work about coronavirus with a professional theatre-maker, while the school is putting together a \u201cvirtual festival\u201d of workshops, masterclasses and projects for final-year students.\nOne of the challenges is how to hold on to the collaborative and collegial aspects of theatre training while maintaining social distancing. Rada students are remaining in touch through a weekly newsletter where they can share ideas. Another solution is suggested by the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland, which has set up a digital platform called \n to keep students and staff connected. The platform includes music, screenings, messages, advice and talks from researchers.\nA virtual scratch space has been created for Lamda students to share the creative work they\u2019re making, while the focus of much of the school\u2019s teaching has turned to individual development of voice and movement. Students record themselves completing physical or vocal exercises and share these with their teachers before receiving one-to-one feedback. \u201cThe teacher is coming in later in the process but with more specialised attention,\u201d explains Frankcom.\nOne silver lining of this difficult situation is the solidarity and support emerging in a sector that\u2019s often forced to compete for students and resources. Across Google docs, Facebook groups and Zoom webinars, teachers of theatre from all over the world are sharing techniques and ideas, from movement exercises on TikTok to online improv games. As Frankcom and others emphasise, educators will need to collectively reflect, share and work together to get through this crisis.\nFor students who are due to graduate this summer and whose final performances and showcases have been cancelled or postponed, the impact of the pandemic is devastating. Drama schools including Mountview and Guildford School of \n have responded by creating online showcases for their graduating students, while final-term productions at Lamda and in many university drama departments have been reinvented as online projects.\nThe theatre industry has also got creative, setting up various networks of remote support for students.

But the most revealing moment comes when she recalls something \n told her early on in her career: \u201cYou must decide why you are doing this job and then never tell anyone.\u201d Looking squarely at Brandreth, Dench says: \u201cAnd I never have.\u201d If I were to make a wild surmise, I would say that her dedication to acting is tied up with her Quaker faith, about which she says little in the interview.

But for many members of the public, a precise date can be put on when the truth properly struck home: 13 March. That was when Tom Hanks \n on Instagram that he and his wife, the actor and singer Rita Wilson, a couple who are universally agreed to be Two of the Nicest Celebrities in the World, had tested positive for the virus in Australia, where Hanks had been shooting Baz Luhrmann\u2019s Elvis biopic. (Hanks, truly cast against type, is playing the notorious bully, Colonel Tom Parker.) On The Daily Show, Trevor Noah \n: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like coronavirus chose Tom Hanks just to send a message to the rest of us. Like prison rules: \u2018If I can get Hanks, I can get to anyone.\u2019\u201d\nPlenty of famous people have since been diagnosed with coronavirus, from Idris Elba to Placido Domingo, yet only Hanks and Wilson made newspaper front pages. And whereas other celebrity diagnoses have prompted debate about why certain people have access to tests while the masses don\u2019t, the news about Hanks and Wilson, both 63, sparked only anxiety on their behalf. \u201cHow dare coronavirus hurt my father!\u201d was the general online reaction, reflecting Hanks\u2019s longstanding status as the United States\u2019 parental figure. Hanks and Wilson occupy a near unique sweet spot of seeming both normal and gobstoppingly famous, making their diagnoses seem all too relatable and totally bizarre.\nAnd their normality is not a pose, judging from the several times I have spotted them out and about in Los Angeles. Once, during Oscars week, I was hanging out in a Beverly Hills hotel where designers had taken over several suites to dress celebrities. Every other person who came in and out of the hotel was a stylist, their heels sky high, their Botox impeccable. Except one: Wilson arrived and left quietly, sporting what looked a lot like a tracksuit and an endearing lack of makeup, never mind Botox. \u201cPicking up one\u2019s own Oscars outfit\u201d might be a very relative kind of normality, but in Hollywood \u201cthe real world\u201d exists on a sliding scale.\nThankfully for Hanks and Wilson, but also the morale of mankind, they are now fully recovered from coronavirus and back home in Los Angeles, where they are \u201cstaying inside and watching a lot of old movies,\u201d Wilson tells me on the phone. \u201cLike \n?\u201d I can\u2019t resist asking. Wilson has been acting since she was 14, but her most famous scene is probably in \n, where her character \n about the Cary Grant/Deborah Kerr 1957 film. She has regained enough of her strength to just about suppress her weariness with the reference: \u201cOh, that\u2019s a good idea, for sure!\u201d she says with only the faintest hint of rolled eyes.\nWilson and Hanks first developed symptoms on 9 March, and were tested the following day. Doctors told them that they were probably exposed to the virus by the same person at the same time, but no one else they know has tested positive and it\u2019s still a mystery as to how they caught it. Wilson, in particular, had tried to be hyper-vigilant: \u201cIt was early March, so people weren\u2019t social distancing yet. But I was already doing no handshakes, no hugging, trying to take my own measures. Then on the plane to Australia, I was like Lady Macbeth \u2013 I couldn\u2019t clean everything enough! The flight attendants were like: \u2018What is with this lady?\u2019 I had wipes, sanitiser, I wiped down \n.\u201d\nTheir symptoms were severe enough for them to be hospitalised: \u201cWe both had a high fever and were extremely achey. I lost my sense of taste and smell, had stomach issues and shivering like you wouldn\u2019t believe. Yeah, I was scared,\u201d she says. To try to bring her fever down, doctors gave her chloroquine \u2013 \u201cnot hydroxychloroquine,\u201d she stresses, referring to the unproven treatment \n. Her temperature did come down, but the side-effects of the drug were \u201cincredibly harsh\u201d.\n\u201cExtreme nausea, vertigo, my muscles felt like wet noodles, so I couldn\u2019t really stand,\u201d she says. They were unaware of the international reaction to their announcement because they hardly watched TV and stayed almost entirely offline, except to be in contact with close friends and family. \u201cWe were just trying to get through it,\u201d she says.\nBack in 2015, Wilson was diagnosed with breast cancer and underwent a double mastectomy. At the time, she told her husband what she wanted him and their two sons, Chet and Truman, to do should she die: \u201cI said: \u2018I want you to be sad for a really long time,\u2019\u201d she laughs. \u201cAnd then I said: \u2018I want you all to throw me a party.\u2019\u201d\nDid she and Hanks have those conversations again?\n\u201cNo, but we did have a different conversation before we were diagnosed. Before I had cancer, I would hear about other people having cancer. I said to him before all this: \u2018Once you\u2019ve had cancer you understand you \n other people. There\u2019s no reason why we shouldn\u2019t get coronavirus \u2013 we could get it.\u2019 And we got it.\u201d\nWilson and Hanks have been married for 32 years and famously have one of the most solid relationships in Hollywood. But going through all this, so far from home, and on their own, would have tested any couple. How did they not lose their minds?\n\u201cI think that having the virus at the same time made it that little bit easier,\u201d she says. \u201cWe were taking care of each other instead of having the pressure of taking care of one person and no one taking care of you or understanding that the person at home needs a break. We were fortunate we were in a place where we understood what the other was going through.\u201d\nWilson was born and raised in Hollywood, the daughter of a Greek mother and Bulgarian father. She started acting as a teenager, appearing on The Brady Bunch and then other US TV shows throughout her 20s. In 1981, when she was 25, she appeared on \n, a sitcom that barely lasted two seasons but launched the career of Hanks. He was married at the time, and has two children from that marriage, including the actor, Colin Hanks. But the two of them reconnected in 1985 when they were both cast in the film, Volunteers, and married in 1988. Since then, Wilson has made a name for herself as a successful producer (My Big Fat Greek Wedding, Mamma Mia!) and a reliable team player; it is always a pleasure to see her pop up in supporting roles in films such as Runaway Bride and Sleepless in Seattle, as well as classy TV shows including The Good Wife and Girls.\nLast year, she produced and appeared in the film \n, \u201cwhich probably people never saw,\u201d Wilson says, alas, accurately. But something from that film stuck in her mind during her recovery: in the movie, her character performs Naughty by Nature\u2019s legendary anthem, \n. After a couple of days in hospital, she and Hanks were allowed to return to their hotel to recover, where they played card games, watched the ubiquitous Netflix documentary \n (\u201cYeah, pretty crazy, ha ha!\u201d) and \n documentary about country music. But Wilson still felt \u201ckind of foggy\u201d, so to get her brain back in shape, she decided to re-learn Hip Hop Hooray. She then \n herself performing it and posted it on Instagram from isolation in Australia, \u201cto let people back home know I was OK, and maybe they could get a smile out of it.\u201d \nThe video took off and currently has 2m likes with adoring comments from Barack Obama (\u201cDrop the mic, Rita!\u201d) to Kim Kardashian (\u201cThe best video EVER!!!!!!\u201d). But the comment that thrilled Wilson the most came from Naughty by Nature themselves, who loved her version. Wilson and the group have now remixed the single and are releasing it to raise money for \n, to support members of the music community.\n\u201cOne of my fans inboxed me and was like: \u2018Hey Vin! Have you seen this?\u2019 And I was like: \u2018What the, oh my Gahhhd,\u2019\u201d says NbN\u2019s Vin Rock with, one suspects, some understatement.\nVin Rock was, he says, \u201caware of [Wilson] from her movies, and definitely her husband, Tom Hanks\u201d. (His favourite Hanks movie, for the record, is \n: \u201cThe way they put him in all those historic scenarios!\u201d)\n\u201cFor us to be able to take this song and this moment and turn it into something positive, I think it\u2019s a beautiful thing,\u201d he says.\nSo he didn\u2019t mind one of his best-known songs being appropriated by an older, very wealthy white woman?\n\u201cNot at all! \n has always been inclusive. Rita\u2019s son Chet is a big hip-hop fan and he gets a lot of kickback from the hip-hop community who want to call him a poseur or culture vulture. But it\u2019s the multicultural people who participated in hip-hop who have made it the phenomenon it is today,\u201d he says.\nChet Hanks \u2013 or Chet Haze, to use his rap name \u2013 has indeed been accused of those things and worse. In the past, he \n his frequent use of the n-word, although he has since \n to his problems with drug addiction. He is clean now, but the 29-year-old got in trouble again earlier this year when he accompanied his parents to the Golden Globes and \n in Jamaican patois on the red carpet. In a recent interview with the New York Times, Tom \n of his children from his first marriage: \u201cThey remember when their dad was just a guy trying to, you know, make the rent. My other kids, they were born after I had established a beachhead in every way. And so their lives were just different.\u201d\nBut Chet became a bit of a star during his parents\u2019 illness. He posted endearingly sensible video updates on their condition (\u201cThey\u2019re not tripping but they\u2019re going through the necessary precautions, obviously\u201d) and amusingly shot down the various conspiracy theories about Hanks being in the illuminati (\u201cIf somebody wrote it on the internet, you know it must be true\u201d). Instead of being mocked by the media, as he had been so often, Chet was now getting headlines \n \u201cHow Tom Hanks\u2019 Son Chet Haze Became a Soothing Voice Amid Covid-19\u201d.\nThat must have made Wilson proud, I say.\n\u201cIt was very sweet of him. Of course, our entire family was concerned about us,\u201d she says, maintaining a protective discretion about her children.\nI tell her that the last time I interviewed her husband, he did the rap that he and Dan Aykroyd \n in the 1987 film Dragnet for me. So now I imagine them as a hip-hop family, all rapping to one another in the evening.\n\u201cOh my God, we make so much fun of that rap, that\u2019s hilarious! People say to me: \u2018Chet must have gotten his rapping from you.\u2019 But we were introduced to it more from our son rather than him being introduced to it from me,\u201d she says.\nWilson is an accomplished musician in her own right and, since 2012, has put out four albums, three of which feature songs she wrote herself.\n\u201cWriting and performing songs has become so much more satisfying, compared to what I was being offered in movies. How many times can you play the understanding, nurturing wife, mother, daughter, grandmother, best friend? I mean, I\u2019ve exhausted the canon of those roles,\u201d she says.\nI tell her that part of what I loved about her Hip Hop Hooray Instagram post wasn\u2019t how she sounded but how she looked \u2013 totally unstyled and un-tweaked. How has she avoided that pressure to look perfect and maintain the face of a 29-year-old while living such a high-profile life in Hollywood?\n\u201cPart of it is my mom rarely wore makeup and I loved seeing her face evolve over time with me. I want my kids to look at the face that they know and understand that it\u2019s just me. Everyone has their vanity but I \u2013 I \u2013 hmmm. How to put this? I \u2026 just \u2026 don\u2019t care that much!\u201d she finishes with a laugh.\nBut did she ever feel the pressure?\n\u201cOh yeah! When I was making Runaway Bride I had Botox, because Botox was new and everyone was getting Botox, and I got it in my forehead. But then I saw this movie, and there\u2019s this emotional \n where I\u2019m firing Richard Gere and my forehead didn\u2019t move. I thought: \u2018Well, that\u2019s not working!\u2019 I tried the lip-fillers around that same period of time, and one day I came home and my kids laughed at me, and I thought: \u2018OK, that\u2019s that!\u2019\u201d\nWilson has to go now \u2013 possibly to watch An Affair to Remember, probably not. \u201cI\u2019m just so thankful to be back to normal again,\u201d she says. So be careful, OK?\u201d After all, as she knows better than most, we\u2019re all just other people now.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/17/rita-wilson-tom-hanks-coronavirus-choloroquine-covid", "title": "Rita Wilson on coronavirus and chloroquine: \u2018I was so ill I could hardly stand\u2019", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 05:00:04 GMT", "summary": "<p>Wilson and her husband Tom Hanks\u2019 Covid-19 diagnosis underlined how pervasive the disease could be.

I\u2019m trying to politely decline all the Zoom offers that are being thrown my way and I\u2019ve been watching lots of TV instead.\nIn terms of total escapism, something I\u2019ve been going back to is my favourite sitcom: \n. I watched it when it was first shown, but I didn\u2019t appreciate just how clever it was. It was always on in the background because my family loved it, but I was a bit more passive. I sat down a couple of weeks ago and went through it all again and realised how the cast are the most brilliant actors. It\u2019s one of the only series that makes me properly laugh.\nIt\u2019s quite nostalgic for me, too, because their house looks like the house we grew up in and it feels very familiar \u2013 it\u2019s like sitting in the living room with your own family. One of my favourite episodes is when they go to Prestatyn. They rarely leave the house, so it\u2019s a big deal for them to be off on their holidays. Then they get to the caravan and Jim\u2019s got the hump because there\u2019s no chip pan and the telly isn\u2019t that good. It really tickles me. I love \n as an actor and he\u2019s such a sweetheart in real life; he\u2019s a really charitable man and very generous with his time.\nMy partner, Kev, and I sat down on the sofa and got through five or six episodes in one go. It\u2019s a running joke that Antony\u2019s always sent to get the tea in the show \u2013 he\u2019s the dogsbody \u2013 and that\u2019s like Kev and I, taking it in turns to delegate and winding each other up.\nThe other show I\u2019ve got into is \n. I do this all the time when people are talking about a show \u2013 for some reason, I only watch it later, mainly because I\u2019m not in on the jokes and all the memes that are going around. Eventually, I gave in with Tiger King and it\u2019s just so captivating \u2013 the characters are so charismatic and, even if I fundamentally disagree with most of what they stand for, I\u2019m still so drawn to them. You\u2019d believe it if it was fiction, but as real life it almost makes no sense.\nAs a film-maker myself, it\u2019s also amazing to see the access the team got for Tiger King and to be able to dedicate that amount of time to one story. That\u2019s a luxury that few of us have now. It got me thinking about a documentary I made on big game hunters a few years ago in South Africa. I remember there was a debate around conservation there and it was less black and white to me, because they donated a lot of their hunted meat to the orphanages in the surrounding areas and they were assuring us that they didn\u2019t shoot anything that was endangered.\nIt\u2019s hilarious that everybody is slightly on Joe Exotic\u2019s side, though, and that they\u2019ve taken to hate \n \u2013 when you look at the pair of them on paper, the way they behave, what they stand for and what they do, they\u2019re just as bad as each other.

It\u2019s a compelling three-hander evoking the 1612 trial of Agostino Tassi, accused of rape by baroque painter Artemisia Gentileschi.\nPhilip Ridley\u2019s new play The Beast of Blue Yonder was due to open at the Southwark Playhouse in London in April. It has now been postponed but a series of new monologues by Ridley responding to the current crisis will be performed online by members of the cast. The first, \n. Further online world premieres from Ridley will follow each week. \n.\nThe internet has been vital to the success of Belarus Free Theatre, one of Europe\u2019s most essential theatre companies, which is forced to operate underground in its restrictive home country after the government \n. They have long rehearsed and created new productions over Skype. Now, the company \u2013 which turns 15 this year \u2013 is \n throughout April, May and June. English subtitles are available for those productions in Russian and Belarusian and each show will be available online for 24 hours. A cast of actors including Samuel West and Stephen Fry will also be reading excerpts from their favourite fairytales in BFT\u2019s new online series.\nWhat better time is there to watch a \u201cgrand-scale experimental pop opera about keeping it together\u201d? \n\u2019s innovative show, staged at Seattle\u2019s Moore theatre in 2014, mixes standup-style routines with a mesmerising musical accompaniment and explores his experience of a rare autoimmune disease. It is one of many films, including \n, that are available to stream from \n. \n.\nWith the help of a carrot, a sponge, the Miracles and some game audience members, Sam is going to tell you about five hook-ups he had through the casual encounters section of online classified-ads board Craigslist. \n, YESYESNONO\u2019s production is an open, affecting and troubling look at searching for intimacy and connection. This hour will leave you reencountering your own life.\nThe outbreak of homeschooling caused by the coronavirus has found many of us playing the role of teacher while still in our dressing gowns. And here\u2019s one unexpected tutor who really commands your attention: Jude Owusu, clad in a dirty bathrobe, with a pen behind his ear and a notepad dangling around his neck. Owusu is Cinna, the poet from Julius Caesar, in this spellbinding film of \n\u2019s monologue, \n magnifying the experiences of minor characters from Shakespeare. \n.\nThe Cure\u2019s Robert Smith tried to laugh about it, cover it all up with lies, because \u2013 all together now \u2013 \n. A powerful piece of rhyme-packed storytelling for the over-eights, Boys Don\u2019t is delivered by four compelling performers and based on real-life experiences of the expectations placed on \u201clittle men\u201d throughout the generations before they even get to the playground. Presented by \n, it\u2019s a Papertale production in association with Apples and Snakes, staged at Brighton festival in 2018.\nShowtunes don\u2019t get much more defiant or rousing than Don\u2019t Rain on My Parade. Sheridan Smith wards off the clouds with a gritty rendition as Fanny Bryce in this production of the classic musical at Manchester\u2019s Palace theatre in 2017. It\u2019s one of the many productions available from \n, whose offerings also include The Crucible starring Richard Armitage at the Old Vic in London, and Maxine Peake\u2019s Hamlet at the Royal Exchange in Manchester.\nIs there a more fitting playwright for our current moment of isolation, uncertainty and endurance than Beckett? In this production, filmed at the marvellously atmospheric Bouffes du Nord in Paris in 2015, \n directs five Beckett shorts with a cast of three (Jos Houben, Marcello Magni and Kathryn Hunter). The production comprises Rough for Theatre I, Rockaby, Neither, Come and Go and Act Without Words II. Feel the rising panic and despair in Rockaby as the solitary, wide-eyed Hunter recounts a descent through long, lonely days.\nEven by Pina Bausch\u2019s standards it\u2019s an arresting opening: a huge wall collapses on stage and across the rubble comes \n, in high heels and a floral frock. After desperately commanding hugs from two suitors, she takes a seat and is pelted with rotten tomatoes. And so begins an epic patchwork of masochistic rituals, nightmares and games, blending the quotidian with the phenomenal, all inspired by the choreographer\u2019s trip to Sicily. A rare chance to watch one of Bausch\u2019s creations \n.\nAt first sight they could be Pina Bausch\u2019s dancers: a procession of performers wearing smart suits and enigmatic smiles, gliding across a stage filled with apples. Bausch\u2019s company memorably balanced apples on their heads in Palermo Palermo, but as Smashed is created by those juggling supremos \n, the fruit is mostly in motion here. Their Bausch homage has the same childlike games, adult fantasy and bruised humour of the German choreographer\u2019s work. Smashed is crisp, fresh and full of flavour. You may never look at an apple in the same way again \u2026\nAll four productions in \n\u2019s starry Oscar Wilde season in the West End can be watched on the online service \n which is offering a 14-day free trial. Edward and Freddie Fox play father and son in An Ideal Husband; Eve Best is a memorable Mrs Arbuthnot in A Woman of No Importance; Kathy Burke directs Lady Windermere\u2019s Fan; and Sophie Thompson is horrified by theatre\u2019s most famous handbag in The Importance of Being Earnest.\nIf you missed its run at \n, here\u2019s a chance to savour Dave Malloy\u2019s song cycle, filmed in New York in 2015. Alternately rousing and yearning, this is a gorgeous hymn to barflies, precious memories and the joys of being a ghost, told with a dash of Edgar Allan Poe and Thelonious Monk. It\u2019s a glorious get-together of a show, as warming as the whiskey handed out to the audience \u2013 but you\u2019ll have to pour your own I\u2019m afraid.\n is a women\u2019s theatre company aiming to \u201cchange the world, one play at a time\u201d.

It was filmed in partnership with The Space.\nCreated for children aged three to seven by Rochdale\u2019s touring theatre company, \n, this sweetly magical show is centred on an alpine weather house whose little male and female figures each pop outdoors depending on the weather (rain for him, sun for her). When the couple start to look after a nest of birds, Gilly Baskeyfield\u2019s story and her jaunty production gently explore themes of family and shared responsibilities. A rainbow of a show, available throughout April. \n.\nThe Royal Opera House may have shut its doors but it has opened up its archive for a \n on its Facebook and YouTube channels. These include the Royal Ballet performing Peter and the Wolf and, on 17 April, The Metamorphosis, a surreal and very gloopy staging of Kafka\u2019s novella, choreographed by Arthur Pita and created for dancer Edward Watson.\nRural touring company \n are releasing shows from their archive every Friday over a period of three months. Deirdre Kinahan\u2019s play Crossings is, according to our critic Arifa Akbar, \u201can unexpected and touching drama about unlikely friendships, postwar homosexuality and the cost of war for women\u201d. \n.\nYou have to hunt to find full theatre productions for very young audiences online, so here\u2019s a little treat. To mark \n on 20 March the lovely Egg in Bath released their wintry 40-minute tale for the under-fours.\nIs this the short-term future of theatre-making? \n, a play set entirely on Facebook, uses a cast of European actors who have never met in person, rehearsed over Skype and filmed on their cameras. Theatre Uncuts production, written by Beats playwright Kieran Hurley, is \n until 23 April. \n.\nTravel restrictions needn\u2019t prevent you from enjoying international theatre online. Paris\u2019s esteemed Od\u00e9on has released its 2018 production of Moli\u00e8re\u2019s satirical 1662 comedy of manners and cuckoldry. Claude Duparfait stars as the foolish Arnolphe, and St\u00e9phane Braunschweig directs.

Our narrator, a talking portrait, lays our scene in Victorian London, and this musical comedy imagines the founding of the popular shoe-repair chain as a union between two companies, the Montashoes and the Keypulets. \n.\nThis is cheating as it\u2019s a TV series, but \n is based on one of the most uproarious and affecting fringe theatre shows of recent years.

Let\u2019s face it, she practically \na drag queen \u2013 that flamboyant makeup, even when dressed in full military garb; the constant outfit changes; the pantomime orgasm every time a powerful weapon shoots its load (and yes, that is the calibre of double entendre we\u2019re dealing with here).\nShe is the reason Goldeneye was so important to me in 1995. She joined the pantheon of clippings from magazines that adorned my bedroom wall, the shrine to everything I considered attractive, aspirational or both. Between 1995, when Goldeneye came out, and my leaving for university in 2001, the lineup evolved. Blur and PJ and Duncan came down, replaced by pictures from FHM and Maxim, replaced in turn by clippings from Kerrang! of \n, Dexter from the Offspring and Davey Havok from AFI. But Xenia remained a constant, her image bleached by the sun over time until the red lipstick became pink.\nIn short, to my 12-year-old eyes, Onatopp was the definition of the perfect woman. GoldenEye was the first Bond film I saw at the cinema (the Tower Park leisure centre in Poole, a magical place where a sign used to boast that \u201ca galaxy of entertainment awaits\u201d), which may have had something to do with my infatuation. In one cinema trip, Bond went from something one might half-watch on television on a bank holiday to a transporting slice of silver-screen fantasy.\nWhile the intention of BBFC certificates may be to primly prescribe a minimum viewing age, they also often function as a guide to the ideal age to see the film in question. That\u2019s very much true of GoldenEye, which was the first Bond film to make use of the 12 certificate. While, to fully grown Bond fans, this may have signalled a toning down of the franchise (the previous entry, The Living Daylights, was a 15), to us 12-year-olds it meant something sophisticated and grownup had been created specially for us \u2013 like when the drinks industry invented alcopops. And I was only \n 12, only \n allowed to see something so hard and cool and dangerous, so I was desperately excited while trying hard to pretend it wasn\u2019t a huge deal, like all cool people.\nAnd boy, did GoldenEye deliver. From the opening action sequence with Bond diving off the massive Contra dam, to Sharpe from ITV (Sean Bean) getting killed in the line of duty (or \n he?), to the first heady thrums of \n, I was hooked. Even the opening credits were insane: a Hugh Hefner fugue state in which ladies open their mouths and guns come out. Are the guns sexy? Are the ladies sexy? What is going on?! I wasn\u2019t sure, but I was riveted.\nI rewatched GoldenEye a few weeks ago, chatting all the while with a group of friends over WhatsApp. It was the first full week of lockdown and we figured it\u2019d be a fun watch. It was, although there was also a fair bit of tedious exposition and some fun but unnecessary padding with Robbie Coltrane and an American guy. In my mind\u2019s GoldenEye, the film is nothing but suspenseful set-pieces and drama, and, of course, that big, man-crushing crush. But isn\u2019t that always the way when you look back at being 12? Nobody remembers the tedious exposition and unnecessary padding; when you look back it\u2019s all suspenseful set-pieces and drama. And of course, the crushes.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/17/my-favourite-film-aged-12-goldeneye-james-bond", "title": "My favourite film aged 12: GoldenEye", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 08:51:04 GMT", "summary": "<p>The first 12-rated Bond film \u2013 and power-thighed assassin Xenia Onatopp in particular \u2013 seemed impossibly glamorous if you were just old enough to be admitted to the cinema</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/lockdown-watch\">Read all the other Lockdown watch choices</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/my-favourite-film-aged-12\">Read all the other My favourite film choices</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/culture/series/what-im-really-watching\">Read all the What I\u2019m really watching choices</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/series/the-classic-film-ive-never-seen\">Read the other classic missed films choices</a></li></ul><p>Her name\u2019s Onatopp. Xenia Onatopp \u2026</p><p>Famke Janssen\u2019s GoldenEye character is a transparently ludicrous fantasy of a sexy, so-called \u201cstrong female character\u201d; the definitive bad-ass Bond babe with thighs that can (and do) crush a man to death, and a line in double-entendres to make a drag queen blush.

The intervening decades have seen me keep up my love of TV \u2013 namely in my role at the Guardian \u2013 but also move forward in my taste for books, which became an equally enduring passion. After university courses stacked with postmodernism, postcolonialism, structuralism and all the other \u201cisms\u201d, I had been sucked into the allure of the weighty, \u201cdifficult\u201d tome; books you read not just for pleasure but to say that you\u2019ve read. Surely a children\u2019s book now would be too easy and too boring?\nPicking up the first book, the 439-page Curse of the Gloamglozer, the drawings were just as vivid as I remembered, beginning with the Hieronymus Bosch-levels of detail in the levitating city of Sanctaphrax. And then I got stuck. There are so many characters with obscure names to remember: Quint, Wind Jackal, Ice Fox, Linius Pallitax, Ramrock, Queep, in the opening pages alone. How did I keep track of all these as a 10-year-old? I had skimmed over the introduction which explains why these sky pirates exist (I was too distracted by the drawings) so now I had no idea why one ship was fighting another and why there were goblin slaves onboard. Aren\u2019t slaves a bit intense for a kids\u2019 book?\nTurns out years of reading nonsensical \u201cliterary\u201d syntax may have taken away my capacity to follow a story meant for children. Yet I persevered, and things began to fall into place. I soon remembered that first buzz of getting hooked on a story that was coloured purely by my imagination. TV fills in all gaps, but books give the mind ample space to roam. I was hooked, too, on the young apprentice Quint\u2019s quest to find out what had been plaguing his master Linius, and his developing relationship with the young Maris. I read all 439 pages in a day, desperate to know the ending.\nWe are understandably all looking for means of escape in these panic-fuelled times. Reading this volume of The Edge Chronicles, I remembered what reading purely for pleasure felt like. What it was to lose yourself in a text, not for its stylistic intricacies or knowing commentary on the world, but for its imaginative capacity to be pure entertainment. It was the feeling of reading purely for yourself. It\u2019s something I\u2019ll be looking out for in my next read \u2013 perhaps the next 17 volumes of the Chronicles?\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2020/apr/17/my-favourite-book-as-a-kid-the-edge-chronicles-by-paul-stewart-and-chris-riddell", "title": "My favourite book as a kid: The Edge Chronicles by Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 10:09:23 GMT", "summary": "<p>Their fantastically detailed illustrations and breathless plots awoke me to books as a child.

He\u2019s less into Marshmello these days and more into Deadmau5, so we\u2019re dancing around. It has been very sweet to be with him, and when I go into his world I\u2019m less stressed, my neck is less stiff. Me and my wife are involved in his education in a big way now \u2013 we are the teachers, the cafeteria workers and his playmates, as he hasn\u2019t seen another child in three weeks. His level of play, of freedom, is a beautiful thing to watch. He\u2019s like: let me play to exhaustion, let me love so hard it hurts. These are things we all need to reaffirm.

I\u2019m thinking of the Bible passage: become as little children.\nThis is going to sound strange but I\u2019ve been listening to my own music too, just reaffirming the things I believe. When I sing No Love Dying, or even songs that people think are dance songs, such as Liquid Spirit, I\u2019m actually talking with my mother, and listening to those songs is a way for me to find reassurance. There\u2019s a song on my new album called Real Truth, about how life and death is the ultimate truth, whether you will or won\u2019t breathe \u2013 so this is coming to me in a new way. Another song, Thank You, I released early because I wanted to say thank you to all these healthcare workers that are working around the world, putting their lives in danger. We\u2019re all distancing ourselves, running away from the fire, and they\u2019re running into it. The people who do that are extraordinary and I want to say thank you with that song.\nWhat I put out into the universe is positive; I\u2019m proud of the way that I haven\u2019t deviated from that, and that I\u2019m still optimistic. And so, in a trying time like this, made even more trying by the sickness of my brother, I lean on the things that I\u2019ve said and hope it reaffirms my belief in them. A magnificent comforter \u2013 a thing that I feel is a gift \u2013 is all of this music, man. I\u2019m so thankful to have this music.\n Thank You by Gregory Porter is out now.

For two decades, she\u2019s poured her energy into fostering creativity in her five-year-old students \u2013 a job, the film suggests, that has drained her faith in society to foster talent. And she\u2019s developed a deep faith in the cult of individual creative talent, which she desires but appears to lack; her poems at a continuing education class in Manhattan go unnoticed by her instructor, Simon (Gabriel Garc\u00eda Bernal). Everywhere, she sees spurned potential \u2013 when she catches her teenage daughter smoking weed, she rips her a new one not for the drugs, but for what she could be doing if she just had the \nOne day after class, she catches one of her students, Jimmy, stringing together words seemingly unprompted, and her malaise coalesces into purpose. She writes his \u201cpoem\u201d down with the fervor of a Delphic oracle, a devotee of the boy\u2019s talent that she believes no one else understands. In a brisk yet emotionally packed hour, Lisa becomes obsessed with the boy. She believes she\u2019s discovered a young Mozart of poetry. Gyllenhaal is mesmerizing as years of pent-up and unspoken feelings warp good intentions into increasingly bad actions: she drags Jimmy into one-on-one time to hone a craft the child is too young to understand, passes off his poems as her own in class, and wheedles her way into being his after-school caretaker. \u201cIt\u2019s OK, kindergarten teachers are allowed to call their students,\u201d she tells Jimmy on the phone, even though of course it\u2019s not.\nThere\u2019s a sharp ache, like pressing a bruise, in watching Lisa spiral from the familiar experience of fixation into dangerous obsession. Colangelo\u2019s style encourages this voyeurism; her camera lingers over characters\u2019 shoulders or in door frames like a practiced eavesdropper. With hardly any background music, she cedes the soundscape to the shuffling of schoolchildren or the smacking of Gyllenhaal\u2019s lips as she considers her words.\nThough the final third takes some far-fetched and excruciating turns that could have derailed the film if not for Gyllenhaal\u2019s grounded performance, Colangelo\u2019s natural style \u2013 unsteady camera orbiting Gyllenhaal\u2019s face \u2013 smartly keeps the focus on Lisa. Her fixation with Jimmy is, as most obsessions go, much more about Lisa\u2019s own dissatisfaction and insecurities as a \u201cshadow\u201d of a person than any talent Jimmy might have, which Colangelo leaves up to interpretation (is he writing his own poems or hearing them somewhere else? It ultimately doesn\u2019t matter).\nIt\u2019s worth watching the film for Gyllenhaal\u2019s performance alone \u2013 in its best moments (at a poetry reading in Manhattan, when Jimmy reveals his primary inspiration, or bargaining with Jimmy\u2019s father), she\u2019s a live wire, a heady mix of yearning and increasingly untenable self-control. But I found viewing The Kindergarten Teacher during an international shutdown to be enlivening. Lisa is unethical, yes, selfish and absolutely delusional, but also readable \u2013 you\u2019re right there with her, understanding without condoning, as she crosses over the line. At a time when most of my human interactions come from FaceTime, to sit with one complicated, well-intentioned but deeply misguided person feels like the opposite of the \u201clow battery\u201d sound my brain makes when I check the news or doom-scroll Twitter. As the stories outside get bigger and bigger \u2013 too massive to comprehend, too overwhelming to engage with \u2013 sometimes, it feels right to let one understated yet commanding portrait draw you in.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/17/kindergarten-teacher-maggie-gyllenhaal-streaming", "title": "My streaming gem: why you should watch The Kindergarten Teacher", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:30:07 GMT", "summary": "<p>The latest in our series of writers highlighting underappreciated films recommends Maggie Gyllenhaal\u2019s standout performance as a woman losing her grip in a tense thriller</p><p>There are many things The Kindergarten Teacher, a 90-minute psychodrama now available to watch online, is not.

My subsequent admiration for Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State proves I\u2019m not immune to the magnetism of its director, \n. And it can\u2019t be that I was averse to the glossy, pumped-up hedonism that was the stock-in-trade of the super-producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, since I\u2019d coughed up my hard-earned paper-round money to see Beverly Hills Cop twice the previous year. Most likely, the deal-breaker was \n. He was too much like the jocks with their laminated skin and torch-beam teeth who flicked one another with towels in the PE changing rooms or mimed slap bass to Level 42 at the school disco. I could get all that for free any time; I didn\u2019t need to pay to watch it on screen.\nMy resistance to Cruise weakened in the late 90s, around the time of Jerry Maguire and Eyes Wide Shut, so it was with something less than dread that I sat down recently for a first viewing of \n. Cruise plays the trainee fighter pilot Pete Mitchell, known to anyone who loves him (and boy, does everyone love him) as Maverick. All the characters have nicknames. Maverick\u2019s best buddy is Goose (Anthony Edwards). His nemesis is Iceman (Val Kilmer). Even their superiors are called Viper (Tom Skerritt) and Jester (Michael Ironside). The US navy consultants listed in the end credits have nicknames, too, such as Rat, Bozo and Flex. The only ones who don\u2019t are women: Charlie (Kelly McGillis), the instructor who becomes Maverick\u2019s squeeze, and Carole (Meg Ryan), Goose\u2019s wife. Carole gets two scenes, larking around in the first one and then \u2013 sad face \u2013 grieving over her husband in the second. Should I have prefaced that plot-point with a spoiler alert? I don\u2019t think so. The moment you find out he has a family, this Goose is cooked.\nOn a visual level, Top Gun has everything I would have expected from a film by one of the Scott brothers: smoke, ceiling fans, Venetian blinds. Not to mention an extreme hardware fetish. In lieu of narrative tension, there are shots of fighter planes scarring the sky. When Maverick has a dilemma to mull over, he rides his motorbike near some palm trees at sunset. To express her desire for him, Charlie zooms around in a convertible displaying a reckless disregard for traffic lights. Bogart and Bacall exchanged sizzling repartee, but this pair may as well be reading to one another from a manual. \u201cYou were in a 4G inverted dive with a MiG-28?\u201d Charlie gasps soon after meeting Maverick. She\u2019s thrilled to find a man who knows all about the thrust-to-weight ratio.\nThere\u2019s a disastrous imbalance between the lead actors, and not only because, as Pauline Kael pointed out in her New Yorker review in June 1986, the \u201cstrapping\u201d McGillis is forever slouching, leaning or bending \u201cso she won\u2019t overpower\u201d her smaller co-star. Their skills aren\u2019t evenly matched either. When McGillis is called upon to appear besotted with this grinning bubble of pure ego, this pair of Ray-Bans on legs, the masquerade is as implausible as it is ridiculous. It\u2019s as if Rita Hayworth were making eyes at Joe Pasquale.\nIt could be argued that Top Gun needs an actor as limited as Cruise was back then. A superior performer would certainly have been under-stretched by the vacuous script and the long sections where nothing happens of any consequence. Almost the entire movie is taken up by training exercises; as pulse-quickening spectacle goes, it\u2019s as compelling as Quidditch. Only in the final reel is there any high-stakes combat, when the young greenhorns are whisked away from their graduation ceremony (\u201cWe have a crisis situation!\u201d) for an emergency dogfight with Russia. A mere 15 minutes later, Maverick and his colleagues are whooping and punching the air. Like us, they know the film must be nearly over.\nThe only surprise after all these years is how little inventiveness and imagination there can be in a movie that has been so influential. The soft-rock songs on the soundtrack keep emphasising how overheated everything is (\u201cThe further on the edge, the hotter the intensity,\u201d insists \n), but few films are so listless and mechanical.\nI had also been misled by seeing \n, the 1994 comedy in which Quentin Tarantino delivers a monologue (purloined from his Pulp Fiction co-writer Roger Avary) about \n: \u201cIt\u2019s a story about a man\u2019s struggle with his own homosexuality.\u201d What\u2019s mysterious to me now is why everyone went wild for that Tarantino riff. Because make no mistake: there is no gay subtext to Top Gun. It\u2019s more the case that gayness is the very text itself, the only possible reading available. How else to explain the charged looks and sweaty, nose-to-nose flirting between Maverick and Iceman, the film\u2019s blatant lack of interest in Charlie and her life, or the script\u2019s obsession with anal imagery? (A representative sample: \u201cI\u2019d like to bust your butt but I can\u2019t\u201d; \u201cNail him, nail him!\u201d; \u201cStay on my wing, I\u2019ll take you all the way in\u201d; \u201cI want somebody\u2019s butt and I want it now!\u201d)\nLooking back, I don\u2019t feel any regret about giving Scott\u2019s film the swerve in 1986 and going instead to see the likes of Aliens, Mona Lisa, After Hours, Desert Hearts, Sid and Nancy, True Stories, Hannah and Her Sisters, Big Trouble in Little China and Jagged Edge. Each of those pictures did what Top Gun couldn\u2019t do: take my breath away.\n", "link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/16/ive-never-seen-top-gun-tom-cruise", "title": "I've never seen \u2026 Top Gun", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 08:35:01 GMT", "summary": "<p>Jock aversion stopped one writer from catching the Tom Cruise film that launched a thousand action sequences.

My subsequent admiration for Crimson Tide and Enemy of the State proves I\u2019m not immune to the magnetism of its director, <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tony-scott\">Tony Scott</a>. And it can\u2019t be that I was averse to the glossy, pumped-up hedonism that was the stock-in-trade of the super-producers Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, since I\u2019d coughed up my hard-earned paper-round money to see Beverly Hills Cop twice the previous year. Most likely, the deal-breaker was <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/tomcruise\">Tom Cruise</a>. He was too much like the jocks with their laminated skin and torch-beam teeth who flicked one another with towels in the PE changing rooms or mimed slap bass to Level 42 at the school disco. I could get all that for free any time; I didn\u2019t need to pay to watch it on screen.</p><p>My resistance to Cruise weakened in the late 90s, around the time of Jerry Maguire and Eyes Wide Shut, so it was with something less than dread that I sat down recently for a first viewing of Top Gun. Cruise plays the trainee fighter pilot Pete Mitchell, known to anyone who loves him (and boy, does everyone love him) as Maverick. All the characters have nicknames. Maverick\u2019s best buddy is Goose (Anthony Edwards). His nemesis is Iceman (Val Kilmer). Even their superiors are called Viper (Tom Skerritt) and Jester (Michael Ironside). The US navy consultants listed in the end credits have nicknames, too, such as Rat, Bozo and Flex. The only ones who don\u2019t are women: Charlie (Kelly McGillis), the instructor who becomes Maverick\u2019s squeeze, and Carole (Meg Ryan), Goose\u2019s wife. Carole gets two scenes, larking around in the first one and then \u2013 sad face \u2013 grieving over her husband in the second. Should I have prefaced that plot-point with a spoiler alert? I don\u2019t think so. The moment you find out he has a family, this Goose is cooked.</p> <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/film/2020/apr/16/ive-never-seen-top-gun-tom-cruise\">Continue reading...</a>", "pic": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/fc84fec11efeb747a93c36186116db59de0a2f3c/273_130_3117_1870/master/3117.jpg?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=37d3f5a28f9175f57da431bde3a405e5"}, "https://www.theguardian.com/books/2020/apr/16/poems-to-get-us-through-nature-walk-by-colette-bryce": {"story": " was born in Derry in 1970 and has received many awards for her work.

Anthony is engaged to Kate: a woman who looks a lot like Lulu but is her exact opposite. She\u2019s kind, but \u201canal\u201d and awkward despite her best efforts.

Colin, a depressed middle-aged divorcee, is taken into the house by Melody, a young French artist who paints his pain. Another property guardian, Sam, struggles to mourn the death of his dad and instead sleazes on to women. When he starts having feelings for a male flatmate, he lashes out with laddish homophobia.\nThis cocktail of sex, grief and deflection is found in Fleabag too \u2013 and it\u2019s not the only overlap between the two shows. Kate would definitely get along with Fleabag\u2019s sister, Claire. Lulu, like Fleabag, is a \n who\u2019s flailing around with her own issues and often hurting people in the process. And the relationship between Lulu and Anthony has some shades of \n.\nAndrew Scott\u2019s priest is a much richer and more satisfying character, but Anthony \nIrish and forbidden (albeit not by divine providence). And the sexual tension between Lulu and Anthony is similar too: it\u2019s all smiles and teasing and \n. That alone makes the show worth watching.\nIn the end, it makes sense that it was Fleabag that launched Waller-Bridge\u2019s international career. It\u2019s a more complex creation, and its first season left more space to grow.

This type of cancer is driven by an overactive gene that makes too much of the HER2 protein, which promotes cancer growth.\n\nEach year, about 50,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with HER2-positive breast cancer. It\u2019s usually curable, but when it spreads it kills most patients. In up to half of them, the cancer reaches the brain, giving that group such a poor prognosis that they have rarely been included in tests of new drugs.\n\nTukysa, pronounced too-KYE\u2019-sah and also known as tucatinib, works by attacking cancer cells from inside and outside to block production of the HER2 protein.\n\n\u201cThis is basically taking the ammunition out of that weapon,\u201d said Dr. Eric Winer, a Dana-Farber Cancer Institute researcher who helped lead the key patient study and consults for Seattle Genetics and other drugmakers.\n\nIn that company-funded study, half the 612 participants got Tukysa along with standard cancer drugs Herceptin and Xeloda. The other half got the two standard drugs and a dummy pill. \n\nIn the group getting Tukysa, 45% survived at least two years, compared with 27% in the placebo group. Among the participants whose cancer spread to the brain, 25% were alive after a year versus none in the placebo group. \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a significant advance,\u201d said Winer.\n\nCommon side effects included diarrhea, fatigue, vomiting and liver function changes. \n\nTukysa has a list price of $18,500 per month, or roughly $111,000 for an average course of treatment, without insurance. Most patients don\u2019t pay that, and Seattle Genetics plans to offer financial aid. \n\nTukysa should be available almost immediately.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Linda A.

A measure of leading economic indicators in the U.S. plunged last month by the most in its 60-year history, the latest in a string of similarly unprecedented data reports. \n\nThe stock market tries to set prices now for where corporate profits and business conditions will be months in the future, and some investors are focusing on the possibility that parts of the economy could reopen, even if it\u2019s not imminent, rather than on the current dismal data. The S&P 500 is on pace for its first back-to-back weekly gain since the market began to sell off in February. \n\n\u201cJust having that light at the end of the tunnel is what people really want to see,\u201d said J.J. Kinahan, chief market strategist at TD Ameritrade. \n\nHe and many other analysts caution that the recent rally and optimism may have been overdone, though, and the market will likely remain volatile. Any improvement in the economy will likely be gradual. \n\n\u201cThere's the opportunity for a big letdown when we get back to work that things aren\u2019t humming immediately,\u201d Kinahan said. \n\nAmong the wisps of optimism that investors were focusing on Friday: \n\n\u2014 A news report cited early progress in a drug candidate for the virus. Analysts cautioned that the encouraging data was only anecdotal, and they were hesitant to put too much stock in it. \n\n\u2014 President Donald Trump unveiled guidelines late Thursday for states to follow as they reopen their economies following widespread shutdowns to slow the spread of the virus. \n\n\u2014 Boeing, one of the stocks hardest-hit by the pandemic, said late Thursday that it will resume production of passenger jets in Washington state next week. It suspended work late last month after workers tested positive for the coronavirus. \n\nTogether, the developments helped lift the S&P 500 by 1.8%, as of 1:45 p.m. Eastern time. Earlier in the day, the index bounced between gains of 2.2% and 1.1%. \n\nFridays have been particularly shaky for the market in recent weeks, as investors look to sell stocks instead of holding them through the weekend when more bad news could pile up.\n\nIn a sign of caution in the market, Treasury yields remain extremely low. The yield on the 10-year Treasury dipped to 0.60% from 0.61% late Thursday. Bond yields drop when their prices rise, and investors tend to buy Treasurys when they\u2019re worried about the economy.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 407 points, or 1.7%, to 23,944, driven largely by a 12.9% surge for Boeing. The Nasdaq was up 0.7%.\n\nGilead Sciences jumped 7.7% following a report that one of its drugs was reducing fevers and respiratory symptoms in COVID-19 patients at a single hospital. Its stock began jumping in after-hours trading Thursday following the report\u2019s release.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s still a great deal we don't know, and thus we hesitate to put too much into the results generated at a single center without a control group,\u201d analysts at J.P.Morgan wrote in a report. \u201cThat said, we\u2019re not overly surprised by the sharp after hours move higher given the amount of hope the market (and society at large) are putting into these types of countermeasures.\u201d\n\nThe market\u2019s gains were widespread Friday, across all 11 sectors that comprise the S&P 500. Energy producers and banks were leading the way, a sharp turnaround from their laggardly ways earlier in the week when worries about the economy were at the forefront.\n\nThe S&P 500 is up more than 27% since hitting a low on March 23, with the most recent gains coming from budding hopes that the pandemic may be leveling off in some of the world\u2019s hardest-hit areas. The rally started after the U.S. government and Federal Reserve promised massive aid for the economy.\n\nBut the S&P 500 is still down roughly 16% from the record set in February as numbers roll in and show the cataclysmic damage being done to the economy. Roughly 22 million U.S. workers have lost their jobs in the last month as businesses shut down. Banks are bracing for consumers and businesses to default on billions of dollars in loans, and no one can say for sure when the economy will get back to anything approximating \u201cnormal.\u201d \n\nIn European trading, the CAC 40 in Paris rose 3.4%, while Germany\u2019s DAX climbed 3.1%. Britain\u2019s FTSE 100 added 2.8%.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index jumped 3.1%, the Hang Seng in Hong Kong advanced 1.6% and South Korea's Kospi leaped 3.1%.\n\nIndia's S&P BSE 100 rose 2.8% after the central bank cut its benchmark interest rate to help the stalled economy and ease financing troubles amid a nationwide lockdown to fight the pandemic. \n\n\u201cHuman spirit is ignited by the resolve to curb the pandemic,\u201d said Reserve Bank of India Gov. Shaktikanta Das. \u201cIt is during our darkest moments that we must focus on the light.\u201d \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Business Writer Elaine Kurtenbach contributed.\ncoronavirus\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-shares-climb-china-data-wall-street-rally-70201932", "title": "Stocks rally worldwide, lifted by hopes for virus progress", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 14:11:02 -0400", "summary": "Stocks are rising Friday as investors latch onto strands of hope about progress in the fight against the coronavirus", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_66a52d7990444abab3776c0f60cfab97_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/national-economies-duress-plea-retail-70207080": {"story": "\nThe outbreak of the \n has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed.

After projecting a 1% GDP expansion in 2020 GDP late last year, it now anticipates a contraction of at least 5.5%. Finnish economists say that retreat could hit 12% if lockdowns continue for another six months. \n\n\u2014 The International Monetary Fund has given Pakistan $1.5 billion in emergency financing to bolster its sagging economy. Pakistan has issued 12,000 rupees (roughly $70) to more than 10 million families hit hardest by a month-long lockdown. \n\n\u2014 India\u2019s central bank reduced its interest rate by 25 basis points, from 4% to 3.75%. The Reserve Bank of India expects a sharp turnaround, with its growth trajectory hitting 7.4% in 2021-22.\n\nSOCIAL MEDIA DISTANCING: Social media companies have actively sought to         quash misinformation that has led to         dangerous behavior. This while the pandemic disrupts internal operations across the tech sector. \n\n\u2014 Facebook employees will work remotely until at least the end of May. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said in a post that employees who feel they can\u2019t return to offices will be allowed to work remotely through at least the summer.\n\n\u2014 Apple shares sank Friday after Goldman Sachs cut its outlook for the company for the third time and recommended clients get rid of the stock. \u201cWe are now modeling a deeper reduction in unit demand through mid 2020 and then a shallower recovery into early 2021,\u201d wrote analyst Rod Hall. Goldman believes services growth will slow substantially in 2021 and as a percentage of revenue will actually stagnate. \n\nApple has begun to rely heavily on services as sales of pricey iPhones slow, particularly during the pandemic. The company last week released a         cheaper iPhone that may resonate more with cash-strapped households. \n\n\u2014 Digital news publisher Vox Media, which is furloughing about 100 people, or 9% of its staff, without pay from May to July, and is cutting pay temporarily between 15% and 25% for those who earn at least $130,000. Salaries for both its CEO and president will be cut in half. The company, which publishes New York magazine and blogs including Vox, Eater and SB Nation, expects revenue declines in the tens of millions.\n\nRETAIL PAIN: Darkened storefronts tell the story of what has happened to the retail sector and         emerging economic data paints an even darker picture. \n\n\u2014 In a letter to Congress, the Retail Industry Leaders Association, which counts among members Best Buy, Walmart and The Gap, asked Congress to allow furloughed and laid off retail workers to accept part-time work shifts without a reduction in state unemployment benefits. \n\nThe association, along with more than 30 industry groups including the National Retail Federation, and the American Booksellers Association, are also seeking a federally-backed fund to provide relief to companies and workers.\n\n\u201cIf we haven\u2019t stabilized the (retail) industry, there isn\u2019t going to be an economic recovery,\" said Tom McGee, CEO of the International Council of Shopping Centers.\n\nTHE CAR BIZ: Manufacturing has         come to a standstill and it is unknown when major industrial players will be able to restart plants. \n\n\u2014 Ford Motor Co. now expects to post a $2 billion first-quarter loss. The automaker has enough cash to get through the end of September even if production doesn\u2019t resume. Ford\u2019s U.S. factories have been shut down for about four weeks, cutting off the company\u2019s main source of revenue. It is hoping to restart factories in the second quarter. \n\nWORK IN A TIME OF PANDEMIC: The outbreak has         disrupted  the labor force in unprecedented ways, damaging livelihoods as well as supply chains. \n\n\u2014 European Union countries are flying in migrants for the spring harvest. Portugal is encouraging college students and laid-off people to till the soil during the pandemic. The Farm Ministry noted Friday that students already get tax breaks if they work during summer vacation and that they could provide a stopgap for any labor shortage.\n\n\u2014 Four employees tied to a Tyson Foods poultry plant in southwest Georgia have died of complications from COVID-19. Three of the employees worked at a plant in Camilla, while the fourth person worked in a supporting job outside the plant, said spokesman Gary Mickelson. Two other Tyson Foods workers have died from the virus at its plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa, he said. \n\nMARKETS: Stocks around the world         rose  on Friday as investors latched onto strands of hope about progress in the fight against the coronavirus. \n\nPANTRY KING: Procter & Gamble posted its biggest revenue spike in decades Friday.

Television news cameras showed the roof ripped off a large portion of the plant and severe damage inside. \n\nSeneca produces transfer cases for F-Series pickup trucks, Ford Explorer and Expedition SUVs, Transit vans and the Lincoln Aviator and Navigator SUVs. Transfer cases shift power to a second drive shaft to run all-wheel-drive vehicles. \n\nFord-owned equipment to make the parts was not \u201cmaterially damaged\u201d by the tornado, but neither Ford nor BorgWarner could say when production would be resumed. Ford closed all of its U.S. factories about a month ago due to the coronavirus outbreak. \n\nThe company is negotiating with the United Auto Workers union about reopening factories but hasn\u2019t given a target date other than sometime in the second quarter. Rival Fiat Chrysler plans to reopen its plants on May 4. \n\nF-Series pickups are the top-selling vehicles in the U.S. and are responsible for much of Ford\u2019s profits. If the plant can\u2019t come back online quickly, it could limit Ford\u2019s production of the lucrative vehicles, further compounding virus-related financial problems for the Dearborn, Michigan, automaker. Earlier Friday, Ford disclosed that it expects to post a $2 billion first-quarter loss when it reports earnings April 28.\n\n\u201cWe are working closely with the supplier to manage the situation and to determine next steps,\u201d Ford said Friday.\n\nBorgWarner is developing plans \u201cas quickly as possible\u201d to bring the factory back online, including contingency plans if it takes longer than it was expected to be closed due to COVID-19. \u201cWe are not giving guidance on a specific date,\u201d spokeswoman Michelle Collins said in a prepared statement.\n\nFord said in a Friday bond-sale filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that it doesn\u2019t have enough information to predict when the BorgWarner factory will be back in operation \u201cor whether or the extent to which this incident will impact our plans to resume production of four-wheel drive and all-wheel drive vehicles.\u201d\n\nBorgWarner wouldn\u2019t say what other auto parts the plant manufactures or what companies they sold to. \n\nSecurity guard Jack Harvill, 77, died when the building he was in outside the plant collapsed in the tornado.

He declined to say how many workers there have tested positive for COVID-19, the disease caused by the new virus. \n\nAmerican workers who process the nation\u2019s meat have proven especially susceptible to the new virus, as they work shoulder-to-shoulder on production lines. Several U.S. plants have closed because of outbreaks, including a large plant owned by         Smithfield Foods in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, that produced roughly 5% of U.S. pork before it was shut down after more than 500 workers became infected. \n\nMickelson said two other Tyson Foods workers have died from the virus at its plant in Columbus Junction, Iowa.\n\n\u201cWe realize everyone is anxious during this challenging time and believe information is the best tool for combating the virus,\" Hector Gonzalez, Tyson's senior vice president for human resources, said in a statement. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re encouraging our team members to share their concerns with us, so we can help address them.\u201d\n\nGonzalez said the company has improved safety measures at the Camilla plant by checking employees' temperatures, requiring workers to wear face coverings, installing dividers at work stations and providing more space in break rooms.

The decision was widely anticipated after the government confirmed Thursday that it was extending the coronavirus lockdown by at least another three weeks.\n\nThe scheme, which allows firms to furlough employees with the government paying cash grants of 80% of their wages up to a maximum of 2,500 pound ($3,200) a month, was originally open for three months and backdated from March 1 to the end of May. \n\nBusinesses ranging from Premier League clubs to bakery chains and airlines are taking part in the scheme, whose cost is expected to run into the tens of billions of pounds.\n\n\u201cIt is vital for people\u2019s livelihoods that the U.K. economy gets up and running again when it is safe to do so, and I will continue to review the scheme so it is supporting our recovery,\u201d Sunak said.\n\nEven with the scheme in place, the country\u2019s unemployment rate is set to spike from its near 45-year low of 3.9%. The Office for Budget Responsibility, an independent body that provides economic forecasts to the government, warned this week that the British economy could shrink by 35% in the second quarter from the previous quarter if the lockdown stays in place for three months until late-June. In that scenario, it said unemployment will more than double, rising by more than 2 million to 10% in the second quarter.\n\nIn another attempt to contain the economic damage, the British government also raised the cap on one of its coronavirus loan guarantee scheme so that all companies with annual revenue of more than 45 million pounds can access support if they were hurt by the lockdown. \n\nMany businesses are struggling to remain solvent and many mid- to large-sized companies are fretting about not being eligible for the Coronavirus Large Business Interruption Loan Scheme, which launches Monday.\n\nSunak, said he wanted to ensure that \u201c no business slips through our safety net of support as we help protect jobs and the economy.\u201d \n\nUnder the scheme, which provides 330 billion pounds of support in total, the government has pledged to give banks an 80% guarantee on the loans.\n\nCompanies with sales of between 45 million pounds and 250 million pounds can apply for 25 million pounds of financing while those with revenue of more than 250 million pounds can draw on 50 million pounds.\n\nAdam Marshall, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said he is pleased to see Sunak respond to \u201creal-world business concerns\u201d and expanding assistance to \u201cgood companies facing severe cash constraints as a result of the coronavirus crisis.\u201d\n\nThere are separate schemes for smaller firms and Britain's largest companies, including financial support for those that opt to keep workers on payroll rather than firing them.\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/uk-broadens-key-schemes-limit-lockdowns-economic-hit-70206761", "title": "UK broadens two key schemes to limit lockdown's economic hit", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 10:47:33 -0400", "summary": "The British government has broadened two of the biggest economic relief programs it has put in place to limit the economic fallout of the coronavirus pandemic", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/WireAP_f89760b78c4b4063a8ae1ff8b6f05a4a_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/trump-governors-options-reopen-economy-70202488": {"story": "WASHINGTON -- \nPresident \n has given governors a road map for recovering from the economic pain of         the \n pandemic, laying out \u201ca phased and deliberate approach\u201d to restoring normal activity in places that have strong testing and are seeing a decrease in COVID-19 cases.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re starting our life again,\u201d Trump said during his daily press briefing. \u201cWe\u2019re starting rejuvenation of our economy again.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cThis is a gradual process.\u201d\n\nThe         new guidelines are aimed at easing restrictions in areas with low transmission of the coronavirus, while holding the line in harder-hit locations. They make clear that the return to normalcy will be a far longer process than Trump initially envisioned, with federal officials warning that some         social distancing measures may need to remain in place through the end of the year to prevent a new outbreak. And they largely reinforce plans already in the works by governors, who have primary responsibility for public \n in their states.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to call your own shots,\u201d Trump told the governors Thursday afternoon in a conference call, according to an audio recording obtained by The Associated Press. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be standing alongside of you.\u201d\n\nPlaces with declining infections and strong testing would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools. \n\nIn phase one, for instance, the plan recommends strict social distancing for all people in public. Gatherings larger than 10 people are to be avoided, and nonessential travel is discouraged.\n\nIn phase two, people are encouraged to maximize social distancing and limit gatherings to no more than 50 people unless precautionary measures are taken. Travel could resume. \n\nPhase three envisions a return to normalcy for most Americans, with a focus on identification and isolation of any new infections.\n\nTrump said recent trends in some states were so positive that they could almost immediately begin taking the steps laid out in phase one.\n\n\u201cThey will be able to go literally tomorrow,\u201d Trump said. \n\nThe guidelines recommend that states pass checkpoints that look at new cases, testing and surveillance data over the prior 14 days before advancing from one phase to another.\n\nGovernors of both parties made clear they will move at their own pace.\n\nDelaware Gov. John Carney, a Democrat, said the guidelines \u201cseem to make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re days, maybe weeks away from the starting line and then you have to have 14 days of declining cases, of declining symptoms and hospital capacity that exists in case you have a rebound,\u201d he said.\n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Trump ally, cautiously floated the idea of reopening parts of the state, but said testing capacity and contact tracing would need to be considerably ramped up before restrictions could be safely lifted.\n\n\u201cAll would be forgotten very quickly if we moved into a stage quicker than we should, and then we got into a situation where we had people dying like flies,\u201d Justice told reporters.\n\nAt the earliest, the guidelines suggest, some parts of the country could see a resumption in normal commerce and social gatherings after a month of evaluating whether easing up on restrictions has led to a resurgence in virus cases. In other parts of the country, or if virus cases pick up, it could be substantially longer.\n\nIn briefing governors on the plan, Trump said they were going to be responsible for deciding when it is safe to lift restrictions in their states. Just days before, he had drawn swift pushback for claiming he had absolute authority to determine how and when states reopen.\n\n\u201cWe have a very large number of states that want to get going and they\u2019re in very good shape,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThat's good with us, frankly.\"\n\nThe guidelines also include general recommendations to businesses as they plan for potential reopenings, suggesting temperature-taking, rapid COVID-19 testing and widespread disinfection efforts in workplaces.\n\nThose most susceptible to the respiratory disease are advised to remain sheltered in place until their area enters the final phase \u2014 and even then are encouraged to take precautions to avoid close contact with other people.\n\nGovernors, for their part, have been moving ahead with their own plans for how to safely revive normal activity. Seven Midwestern governors announced Thursday they will coordinate on reopening their economies. Similar pacts were announced earlier in the week in the West and Northeast. \n\nTwo in three Americans expressed concerns that restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus would be eased too quickly, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday. More than 33,000 people in the United States have died from the virus.\n\nU.S. Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams encouraged all Americans to study the new guidelines to prepare for when their areas are ready to reopen.\n\n\u201cWe want you all to be thinking about it now,\" Adams told \u201cFox & Friends\"on Friday. \"We don\u2019t want you to rush.

All but $5.6 billion is taxpayer money.\n\nIOC and Japanese officials say they don't know the cost of the one-year delay, but estimates have put it at $2 billion to $6 billion.         Nearly all of the added costs fall to Japan  under an agreement signed in 2013 when Tokyo was awarded the games.\n\nCoates confirmed the IOC would be spending \u201cseveral hundred million dollars\u201d because of the postponement.

As countries lift restrictions on movement, tracing whether someone has come into contact with an infected person will be key to allowing a return to normal life.\n\nThe use of such apps would do away with the need for the time-consuming, painstaking work involved in questioning people who have contracted the disease to try to work out where they picked it up.\n\nIn a new set of         guidelines, the European Commission says that public trust is paramount for the system to work because the apps are most effective when many people use them.\n\n\u201cSuch apps can only show their full potential if many people use them. Therefore, we want to give Europeans the trust in these apps,\u201d said commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental that the instillation and use of an app is voluntary.\u201d\n\nConcern is rife about the potentially invasive nature of tracking people\u2019s movements or the risk that their data might be shared with unknown authorities without their consent. In the past, European consumer groups have routinely warned about the privacy risks posed by using online \n devices.\n\nThe commission said the platforms should be managed by public \n authorities and dismantled once they are no longer needed. Their use should be voluntary, and no one should be punished for deciding not to download them.\n\nThe apps should function through Bluetooth wireless connections and work without any other mobile phone location services being activated. Ideally, data would be protected by state-of-the-art encryption and only be kept as long as needed, the commission said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t recommend to use personal location for this. We actually say that it is not necessary,\u201d Bahrke said. \u201cThe idea of tracing is not that the user knows who might have had it, but that he has had contact with someone who could have had it.\u201d\n\nEssentially, it\u2019s a case of who, not where. The idea is to warn people when they have come close, and for a certain time, to someone who is infected, but not to log exactly where that contact might have taken place.\n\nThe apps should then provide advice about the best next steps, like whether to self-isolate, where to be tested and what to do to manage any symptoms. It could also allow patients to communicate with their doctors.\n\nWhile no single Europe-wide app is likely to be developed, the commission said it\u2019s important to align national systems given that many people commute to work in neighboring countries.\n\nThe Dutch government is organizing an online \u201cappathon\u201d over the weekend so that experts and members of the public can comment on apps being considered for use in the Netherlands to track and trace infections and report symptoms to health authorities.\n\nThe government is expected to announce next week whether or not to deploy the apps in its fight against the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Corder in The Hague contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at         http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak     \ncoronavirus\nhealth\nhealth\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/public-trust-key-eu-insists-developing-virus-apps-70204038", "title": "Public trust key, EU insists, in developing virus apps", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:33:17 -0400", "summary": "As European countries develop coronavirus tracing apps, the EU is urging them to make the platforms voluntary and ensure that the many national systems can work together", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/virginia-protest-gty-ps-200417_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/relief-checks-lifeline-cushion-70203827": {"story": "\nMillions of Americans received government relief checks this week, and more are on the way. For some, the payment gets them to a more comfortable place financially; for others, the money just gets them to next month. \n\nBridget Hughes, a mother of three, received a $2,200 stimulus check this week that allowed her to pay April\u2019s rent and utilities, and to buy groceries. But now she\u2019s worried about rent for May. \n\nHughes usually works two fast-food jobs; her husband works at a gas station. The \n outbreak is making it even harder for the Kansas City, Missouri family to make ends meet. Hughes had to take two weeks off unpaid to quarantine herself after a relative tested positive and then her hours were greatly reduced. \n\nHughes won\u2019t get another pay check until mid-May and her husband\u2019s relief payment has yet to arrive. While grateful for the federal aid, she remains anxious. \n\n\u201cIt was definitely was a necessity,\u201d she said. \u201cBut at the same time, I feel like it\u2019s a Band-Aid. It\u2019s going to get us through these next 30 days to where we\u2019re not homeless ... (but) we don\u2019t have anything to fall back on.\u201d\n\nThe coronavirus has ravaged the economy as limitations to stop its spread have shuttered many businesses. About 22 million Americans have applied for unemployment benefits in the past month alone \u2014 that\u2019s about one in seven workers. \n\nThe relief payments are just one piece of a massive $2.2 trillion economic rescue package rolled out by the government to try and counter the devastating impacts of the pandemic. Congress also approved increased and expanded unemployment benefits, delayed tax bills and created a lending program to help small businesses keep people on their payroll. \n\nThe one-time relief payments will offset some of the economic shock of the health crisis, said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. He expects the payments to boost U.S. gross domestic product -- the broadest measure of economic output -- by $293 billion, or about 1.4% of pre-crisis levels, mostly this spring and summer.\n\nZandi expects most people will spend the money on necessities such as rent and \n. \n\nThe Treasury Department says about 80 million Americans received their payments as of Wednesday. Millions more have signed up to get direct deposit, and paper checks will be distributed starting later this month. \n\nEligible adults will see a payout up to $1,200 \u2014 married couples up to $2,400 \u2014 plus $500 per child. Eligibility is cut off at earnings of more than $99,000 for individuals and $198,000 for married couples.\n\nThe payouts are twice the size of the stimulus payments given in 2008, according to the Tax Policy Center. \n\nAmericans eager to find out the status of their payments caused delays on the IRS website and the sites of several banks this week as well as long waits on phone lines. Credit counselors received a flurry of calls fomr people worried that debt collectors would take their payments to cover outstanding debts, said Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. (The funds are not protected, but debt collectors would need a court judgment to take them.)\n\nThe anxiety is just a small indicator of how financially stretched Americans were even before the virus outbreak. \n\nExperts generally suggest people have three to six months of savings set aside for emergencies, but few do. At least one-quarter of American adults say they wouldn\u2019t be able to cover an unexpected expense of $400, according to a survey done by the Federal Reserve before the pandemic. \n\nAmericans have also been taking on more debt in recent years, as a growing economy gave them confidence they would have the means to pay it off. U.S. consumer borrowing is at an all-time high of $4.2 trillion, according to the Fed. That does not include home mortgages or other loans secured by real estate. \n\nLenders have been encouraged to provide relief for loans as well as avoid evictions and foreclosures. Wells Fargo, one of the nation\u2019s largest lenders, said it deferred more than one million payments representing $2.8 billion of principal and interest and waived more than 900,000 fees worth more than $30 million.\n\nStill, Mariel Beasley, Co-Founder of Common Cents Lab at Duke University said that \u201cmany households are teetering.\u201d They will use the relief check to get current on bills they\u2019ve already missed and to purchase food \u2014 in other words, the money has already been spent before it arrives. Those who still have some income and savings may try to stretch the cash as far as possible. \n\nSome taxpayers, however, admit the payment is nice to have \u2014 but not a must-have. \n\nCharlette and Richard Kremer of Lewiston, Idaho got their $2,400 payment on Wednesday. The retired couple used the money to pay some lingering credit card debt from Christmas and plan to use the rest to pay their state tax and maybe help pay some costs of their son\u2019s wedding reception later this year. \n\nWhile they welcome the money, they say there are others who could use it more \u2014 particularly those with lower incomes. \n\n\u201cThose are the folks that are really going to be hurting,\u201d Richard Kremer said. \u201cThis $1,200 is just going to kick the wolf back from the door. It\u2019s not going to keep him away.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAdrian Sainz in Memphis, Tennessee and Paul Wiseman in Washington contributed to this report. \ncoronavirus\nfood\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/relief-checks-lifeline-cushion-70203827", "title": "Relief checks are a lifeline for some, a cushion for others", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:24:53 -0400", "summary": "Millions of Americans received government relief checks this week, and more are on the way", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Lifestyle/WireAP_f30d133a421d4f1f8be95500921d6421_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/europe-car-sales-tank-55-march-coronavirus-lockdowns-70202120": {"story": "MILAN -- \nEuropean car sales tanked last month amid strict lockdown measures to contain the coronavirus that shut down dealerships for at least half of March and dried up consumer spending. \n\nThe European carmaker\u2019s association, ACEA, said Friday that new car registrations \u201crecorded a dramatic drop\u201d of 55% to 567,308 units.\n\nThe drop is worse even than during the 2008-9 global financial crisis, which triggered a six-year slump in car purchases.

Consumer spending, which supplied 80% of last year\u2019s growth, and factory activity were weaker than expected. \n\nChina, where the pandemic began in December, is the first major economy to start to recover after the ruling Communist Party declared the virus under control. Factories were allowed to reopen last month, but cinemas and other businesses that employ millions of people still are closed. \n\nThere are signs that after an \u201cinitial bounce\u201d as controls ended, \u201cthe recovery in activity has since slowed to a crawl,\u201d said Julian Evans-Pritchard of Capital Economics in a report. \n\n\u201cChina is in for a drawn-out recovery,\u201d he said. \n\nThe last contraction this big was 5.8% in 1967 during the upheavals of the ultra-radical 1965-75 Cultural Revolution, according to Iris Pang of ING.\n\nForecasters earlier said China might rebound as early as this month. But they say a sharp, \u201cV-shaped\u201d recovery looks increasingly unlikely as negative export, retail sales and other data pile up. \n\nInstead, they expect a gradual crawl back to growth in low single digits in the coming quarters. For the full year, forecasters including UBS, Nomura and Oxford Economics expect little to no growth. \n\nIn total, China has reported 4,632 deaths after the total for Wuhan, the city of 11 million people at the center of the outbreak, was revised upward Friday. The mainland has announced 82,367 cases.\n\nRetail sales fell 19% from a year earlier in the first quarter. That improved in March, the final month of the quarter, to a decline of 15.8%. But consumers, jittery about possible job losses, are reluctant to spend despite government efforts to lure them back to shopping malls and auto showrooms. \n\nThat is a blow to automakers and other companies that hope China will power the world economy out of its most painful slump since the 1930s. \n\nJob-hunter Ni Hong\u2019s challenge highlights the problem. Ni, 32, quit her job in Beijing in January to find a new one, but the virus disrupted those plans. Ni is paying her mortgage out of her savings and avoiding other spending while she looks in a market flooded with newly laid-off workers.\n\n\u201cIn the past, there were maybe two or three candidates for a post,\u201d Ni said. \u201cNow, I have eight to 10 competitors, so the chance for me to be eliminated is much higher.\u201d\n\nThat is a political challenge for the ruling party, which bases its claim to power on China's economic success. The party appealed to companies to keep paying employees and avoid layoffs during the shutdown. But an unknown number have failed, adding to public anxiety. \n\nThe economy already was squeezed by a tariff war with President Donald Trump over Beijing\u2019s technology ambitions and trade surplus. Last year\u2019s growth sank to a multi-decade low of 6.1%.\n\nExports fell 6.6% in March from a year earlier, an improvement over the double-digit plunge in January and February. But forecasters say demand is bound to slump in America and Europe as anti-virus controls keep shoppers at home. \n\n\u201cLingering consumption weakness and sliding foreign demand will weigh on the upturn,\u201d said Louis Kuijs of Oxford Economics in a report.\n\nGrowth was stronger than some forecasts that called for a contraction of up to 16% but this is the biggest contraction since market-style reforms started in 1979. \n\n\u201cThe numbers were even uglier than most anticipated, which is good!\u201d said Andy Rothman of Matthews Asia in a report. \u201cThese ugly numbers indicate that the leadership didn\u2019t fudge the data to hide the seriousness of the situation.\u201d\n\nInvestment in factories, real estate and other fixed assets, the other major growth driver, sank 16.1%. \n\nAuto sales sank 48.4% from a year earlier in March. That was better than February\u2019s record 81.7% plunge but is on top of a 2-year-old decline that is squeezing global and Chinese automakers in the industry\u2019s biggest global market. \n\nAsian stock markets rose following the announcement, which was in line with investor expectations. By mid-afternoon, Tokyo\u2019s benchmark Nikkei 225 index was up 3% and Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng was 2.4% higher. \n\nThe ruling party has yet to announce this year\u2019s official growth target. It has been at least 6% in previous years. Beijing looks likely to miss its target of doubling incomes from 2010 levels by this year. \n\nControls on Beijing, the capital, and some other cities have been tightened to prevent a resurgence of the disease. Most foreigners are barred from entering the country.\n\nBeijing is boosting spending on a \u201cNew Infrastructure\" Plan that includes next-generation telecom networks, artificial intelligence, electric vehicle charging and data centers. But leaders don't want to pump too much money into the economy with full fledged stimulus for fear of adding to debt or pushing up inflation that is near a seven-year high. \n\nCarrying out that infrastructure investment \u201cwill take a much longer time than it would do without social distancing in place,\u201d said Pang of ING. \u201cRecovery will be a long road.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP video producer Wayne Zhang and researcher Yu Bing contributed. \n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/china-suffers-worst-economic-drop-70s-virus-battle-70199815", "title": "China's economy in worst downturn since '60s in virus battle", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 05:01:34 -0400", "summary": "China faces a drawn-out struggle to revive its economy after it suffered its biggest contraction since possibly the mid-1960s while fighting the coronavirus", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_cec61e0615a943efb13640c255a65c11_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/asian-stocks-slide-weak-us-data-add-global-70177165": {"story": "BANGKOK -- \nShares surged Friday in Asia after China reported economic data that, while bleak, was better than expected. \n\nThe strong open followed an overnight rally on Wall Street powered by buying of Amazon, \n stocks and other market niches that are thriving in the coronavirus crunch. \n\nChina reported its economy contracted 6.8% in January-March as the country battled the coronavirus.

Netflix also reached an all-time high as people spend more time than ever at home, while health care stocks in the S&P 500 rose 2.2% for the biggest gain among the 11 sectors that make up the index. \n\nAs a sector, financial stocks weighed heaviest on the market with banks continuing their weeklong slide. Worries are high that business-shutdown orders \u2014 and the punishing sweep of layoffs they\u2019re causing \u2014 will force households and businesses to default on billions of dollars of loans. JPMorgan Chase lost 3.8%, and Citigroup slid 5.5%.\n\nEnergy companies and owners of shopping malls were also hard hit as people stay at home amid efforts to slow the spread of the virus. Simon Property Group lost 13.3%, and Occidental Petroleum fell 10.4%.\n\nAnalysts see the separation of winners and losers as an encouraging sign for the market. Earlier in the sell-off, fears about the impending recession pulled the plug for stocks across sectors. \n\n\u201cWe had a market that was dotted with indiscriminate selling,\u201d said Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial. \u201cNow you have a differentiation within the market, which indicates a healthier backdrop.\u201d\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 16.19 points to 2,799.55. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added 0.1% to 23,537.68, the Nasdaq jumped 1.7% to 8,532.36 and the Russell 2000 index of smaller stocks slumped 0.5% to 1,178.09.\n\nWhite House guidelines outlining a phased approach to reopening businesses, schools and other areas of life have hinted at light at the end of the shutdown tunnel. \n\nSome optimistic investors are focusing on the massive aid for the economy promised by the Federal Reserve and the U.S government. They also point to recent signs that the outbreak may be leveling off in some of the world\u2019s hardest-hit areas. \n\nThe dueling sentiments have helped the S&P 500 nearly halve its loss since falling from its record high in mid-February. Stocks were down by nearly 34% in late March, but a recent rally has trimmed the loss to roughly 17%.\n\nUltimately, many professional investors say they expect the market to remain volatile until the worst of the outbreak passes. \n\n\u201cThis is a consumer-led economy,\u201d said Prudential\u2019s Krosby. \u201cThe question is: At what point does the consumer feel comfortable enough to begin even a quasi-normal life outside their homes?\u201d\n\nTreasury yields fell again and remain extremely low, though, which shows how pessimistic investors are about the economy\u2019s prospects. \n\nThe yield on the 10-year Treasury fell to 0.60% on Thursday but was at 0.68% by early Friday. Yields fall when bond prices rise. Investors tend to bid up Treasurys when they\u2019re worried about the economy.\n\nOil prices were holding steady.

China has said the mask maker had clearly informed a Dutch purchasing agent that they were non-medical masks.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a call with top Chinese foreign policy adviser Yang Jiechi this week, stressed the importance of facilitating medical supply exports to meet critical demand in the United States. \n\nAmerican officials have made the point that U.S. companies making medical protective gear and other products in China should be allowed to export them as they see fit.\n\nTerry Branstad, the U.S. ambassador to China, said there had been a slowdown in the provision of supplies that appeared to be caused by China\u2019s implementation of stricter quality standards.\n\nU.S. officials also said some air shipments had been blocked or delayed because of Chinese requirements that inbound flight crews be tested for the virus and cleared. Hugo Yon, the senior official in charge of aviation at the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Economic and Business Affairs, told reporters on a conference call Thursday that those specific issues appeared to have been resolved.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said this month he would try to block manufacturing giant 3M Co. from exporting N95 masks to other countries. 3M warned other governments might retaliate and said later an agreement was reached to allow foreign sales.\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/china-plans-limit-export-anti-virus-supplies-70179191", "title": "China says no plans to limit export of anti-virus supplies", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 22:06:55 -0400", "summary": "China is promising not to restrict exports of medical goods needed to fight the coronavirus pandemic amid tension over scarce supplies of masks and ventilators", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_28b2d49920874b85b5263cb7cedbc72f_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/price-high-thais-dwindling-incomes-sell-off-gold-70178458": {"story": "BANGKOK -- \nWith gold prices rising to a seven-year high, many Thais have been flocking to gold shops to trade in their necklaces, bracelets, rings and gold bars for cash, eager to reap profits during an economic downturn. \n\nGold shops are de facto financial institutions in Thailand and generally have remained open in the country where measures taken to guard against the spread of COVID-19 have been less severe than in other countries. Long lines formed all week outside major gold shops in Chinatown in the capital Bangkok.\n\nThe sell-off has some gold shop owners claiming they are facing a liquidity crunch, leaving them short on cash to continue purchasing. \n\nThey are unable to carry out their normal practice of quickly reselling the gold abroad because of the greatly reduced number of flights to ship the gold and a shortage of buyers in other countries, who are restricted by lockdown orders and market closures.\n\nJitti Tangsithpakdi, chairman of the Gold Traders Association and owner of Chin Hua Heng Goldsmith Co, told The Associated Press that more than 90% of recent gold shop customers are sellers. \n\nShops are bound by tradition to buy back the products they sell. Prices are fixed by an industry association.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s never been a case where a goldsmith doesn\u2019t buy back the gold, especially if the gold carries markings showing it is from their own shop,\u201d Jitti said. It would destroy customers\u2019 trust in that goldsmith. \n\nPrime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha, heeding industry appeals, urged restraint on the part of sellers.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m asking people to sell gradually, not in large amounts, as shops may face a cash crunch,\u201d he said Wednesday.\n\nThe price of gold has been rising since the \n crisis began. That\u2019s typical of times of uncertainty as people shift their wealth into what they believe is a hedge against uncertain financial markets. Gold was trading Thursday at $1,755.60 an ounce on the New York Mercantile Exchange, the highest level since late 2012.\n\nMany Asians hold gold as savings and investments. In Bangkok, gold shops are clustered in Chinatown, where long lines were stretched even further by social distancing. Jitti said he believes the current wave of sellers mostly are seeking to profit from the high price.\n\nHowever, some of those waiting said they were selling their gold to get cash to support their families since many have lost their jobs.\n\nSaranya Prasert, a fruit exporter, said the COVID-19 crisis has halted her business and her family is struggling for money. They are selling gold jewelry that they had kept for more than 10 years as savings. \n\n\u201cThe reason we are selling our gold today is because we need to increase our cash flow. We still have to pay our employees so need the money now for the expense. The situation has impacted us. We can\u2019t export our goods.\u201d\n\nMany in line had similar stories. Not all of them were selling because the price is high. \n\nPleonjit Sukcharoen, an office worker, said that while she is lucky that she still has a job, her sister is a street vendor who is unable to work because of a market shutdown order and now needs help with her hospital bill.\n\nTo help her sibling, she decided to sell her stash of gold that she had received as bonuses over the years from her employer.\n\n\u2014\u2014-\n\nAssociated Press journalist Preeyapa T.

The alert, which will start appearing on Facebook in the coming weeks, will direct users to a site where the World Health Organization lists and debunks virus myths and rumors.\n\nFacebook, Google and Twitter         are introducing stricter rules, altered algorithms and thousands of fact checks to stop the spread of bad misinformation online about the virus. \n\nChallenges remain. Tech platforms have sent home human moderators who police the platforms, forcing them to rely on automated systems to take down harmful content. They are also up against people\u2019s mistrust of authoritative sources for information, such as the WHO. \n\n\u201cThrough this crisis, one of my top priorities is making sure that you see accurate and authoritative information across all of our apps,\u201d \n CEO Facebook wrote on his Facebook page Thursday.\n\nThe company disclosed Thursday that it put more than 40 million warning labels in March over videos, posts or articles about the coronavirus that fact-checking organizations have determined are false or misleading. The number includes duplicate claims \u2014 the labels were based on 4,000 fact checks.\n\nFacebook says those warning labels have stopped 95% of users from clicking on the false information.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a big indicator that people are trusting the fact checkers,\u201d said Baybars Orsek, the director of the International Fact-Checking Network. \u201cThe label has an impact on people\u2019s information consumption.\u201d \n\nBut Orsek cautioned that the data Facebook provided should be reviewed by outside editors or experts, and called on the historically secretive company to release regular updates about the impact of its fact-checking initiative. \n\nOrsek\u2019s organization is a nonprofit that certifies news organizations as fact checkers, a requirement to produce fact-checking articles for Facebook. Facebook has recruited dozens of news organizations around the globe to fact check bad information on its site. The Associated Press is part of that program. \n\nFacebook will also begin promoting the articles that debunk COVID-19 misinformation, of which there are thousands, on a new information center called \u201cGet The Facts.\u201d Putting trustworthy information in front of people can be just as useful, if not more, than simply debunking falsehoods.\n\nStill, conspiracy theories, claims about unverified treatments, and misinformation about coronavirus vaccines continue to pop up on the site daily\u2014 sometimes circumventing the safeguards Facebook has implemented. \n\nThe new notification feature also only applies to posts on users' main news feed \u2014 not in groups, where misinformation often spreads unchecked, and not on WhatsApp or Instagram, though Facebook has put some other protections in place on those platforms. \n\nThat means a lot of users won't get the new alert from Facebook, said Stephanie Edgerly, an associate professor at Northwestern University who researches audience engagement. She said many users might simply see a false claim in their Facebook feed but not share, like or comment on it. \n\n\u201cA lot of what we know about how people scroll through their news feed not clicking on things, they still reading posts or headlines, without clicking on the link,\u201d Edgerly said. \n\nFacebook users, for example, viewed a false claim that the virus is destroyed by chlorine dioxide nearly 200,000 times, estimates a new study out today from Avaaz, a left-leaning advocacy group that tracks and researches online misinformation. \n\nThe group found more than 100 pieces of misinformation about the coronavirus on Facebook, viewed millions of times even after the claims had been marked as false or misleading by fact checkers. Other false claims were not labeled as misinformation, despite being declared by fact-checkers as false. \n\n\u201cCoronavirus misinformation content mutates and spreads faster than Facebook\u2019s current system can track it,\u201d Avaaz said in its report. \n\nThis is especially problematic for Italian and Spanish misinformation, the report said, because Facebook has been slower to issue warning labels on posts that aren't in English. Avaaz also noted that it can take as long as 22 days for Facebook to label misinformation as such \u2014 giving it plenty of time to spread. \n\nFalse claims about coronavirus treatments have had deadly consequences. \n\nLast month, Iranian media reported more than 300 people had died and 1,000 were sickened in the country after ingesting methanol, a toxic alcohol rumored to be a remedy through private social media messages.

The losses translate to about 1 in 7 American workers.\n\nWhile many Americans have chafed at the damage to their livelihoods, business leaders and governors have warned that more testing and protective gear are needed before they can start lifting the lockdowns and other restrictions that have all but strangled the economy. Health experts have cautioned that easing restrictions too soon could allow the virus to come storming back. \n\n\u201cMy No. 1 focus is to keep my family safe, so I\u2019m really not in a hurry to put an end to this,\u201d said Denise Stockwell, who is about to lose her job in marketing at Cornell University in Ithaca, New York. \n\nBut conservative economist Steven Moore, a Trump ally, said there will be 30 million people out of work in the country if the economy doesn\u2019t open back up soon. \u201cAnd that is a catastrophic outcome for our country. Period,\u201d he said. \u201cYou're going to have social chaos.\u201d\n\nWorldwide, the outbreak has infected more than 2.1 million people and killed more than 140,000, according to a tally by Johns Hopkins University, though the true numbers are believed to be much higher. The death toll in the U.S. reached about 31,000, with around 650,000 confirmed infections.\n\nThe spread of the virus is declining in such places as Italy, Spain and France, but is rising or continuing at a high level in Britain, Russia and Turkey, authorities said.\n\nIn other developments:\n\n\u2014 Vladimir Putin postponed Russia's grand         Victory Day parade May 9 in Red Square marking the 75th anniversary of Nazi Germany\u2019s defeat in World War II. Since Soviet times, Victory Day has been the nation\u2019s most important holiday, reflecting its wartime losses, put at more than 27 million dead.\n\n\u2014 New York, the most lethal hot spot in the U.S., reported more encouraging signs, with a drop in the daily number of deaths statewide and the overall count of people in the hospital. \u201cWe\u2019ve controlled the beast. We\u2019ve brought the rate of spread down,\u201d Gov. Andrew Cuomo said. Still, Cuomo extended the state's lockdown through at least May 15, and New York City is lining up 11,000 empty hotel rooms to quarantine people living in crowded apartment buildings.\n\n\u2014 Police acting on an anonymous tip found at least 18 bodies over two days at a nursing home in Andover Township, New Jersey. Corpses were packed into a room used to hold the dead until they can be picked by a funeral home.\n\nUnder the new Trump administration         road map, places that are turning the corner on the virus would begin a three-phase gradual reopening of businesses and schools, with each phase lasting at least 14 days, to ensure that the outbreak doesn\u2019t make a resurgence.\n\nMany Americans, especially in rural areas and other parts of the country that have not seen major outbreaks, have called on governors to reopen their economies. More than 3,000 turned out this week to decry the Michigan governor\u2019s restrictions, police broke up a demonstration in North Carolina, and protests also took place in Oklahoma, Kentucky and Virginia.\n\n\u201cThose people that know they\u2019re vulnerable, self-quarantine. And everybody else, let them go back to work,\" Aaron Carver, a laid-off construction worker said at a protest in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe decision of whether to relax the restrictions rests not with the White House but with the state and local leaders who imposed them in the first place. Seven Midwestern governors announced Thursday that they will coordinate on reopening their economies, after similar pacts were reached among states in the Northeast and on the West Coast. \n\nWest Virginia Gov. Jim Justice, a Trump ally, said capacity and contact tracing would need to be considerably ramped up before restrictions could be safely lifted.\n\n\u201cAll would be forgotten very quickly if we moved into a stage quicker than we should, and then we got into a situation where we had people dying like flies,\u201d Justice said.\n\nOregon Gov. Kate Brown said the White House guidance \"makes it clear: as we begin to see areas of Oregon that have declining cases of COVID-19, the best path to reopening is still a cautious one that proceeds carefully and incrementally.\u201d \n\nTwo in three Americans expressed concerns that restrictions meant to slow the spread of the virus would be eased too quickly, according to a Pew Research Center survey released Thursday.\n\nEconomists said the unemployment rate could reach 20% in April, the highest since the Depression of the 1930s. Layoffs are spreading well beyond stores, restaurants and hotels to white-collar professionals such as software programmers and legal assistants.\n\nThe lifting of restrictions, when it happens, won't be like flipping a switch. Restaurants and other businesses may be reopened in phases, with perhaps a limited number of entrances or reduced seating areas, while grocery stores may stick with one-way aisles and protective shields at the cash registers, experts say.\n\nEven then, it could take awhile before business comes back, if China and certain places in Europe are any indication.\n\nJeremiah Juncker, manager of the Rappourt pub in Ann Arbor, Michigan, wonders whether anyone would come if he were even allowed to reopen.\n\n\u201cIt might be \u2018back to normal\u2019 for everyone else, but people still don\u2019t feel comfortable gathering at restaurants and bars,\u201d he said.\n\nMany European countries, like the U.S., have seen heavy job losses, but places like Germany and France are using government subsidies to keep millions of people on payrolls instead of letting them go on unemployment.\n\nBut political leaders on the Continent are still trying to find a balance between their country's health and its wealth. \n\nItaly\u2019s hard-hit Lombardy region is pushing to restart manufacturing when the nationwide lockdown ends in early May, while Britain, with over 13,700 dead, extended its nationwide lockdown for at least three more weeks.\n\nSwiss authorities announced a staggered series of reopenings. \n\n\u201cLadies and gentlemen, the transition is beginning,\u201d Home and Health Minister Alain Berset said. \u201cWe want to go as fast as possible, and as slow as necessary.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press journalists around the world contributed.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been edited to correct that Aaron Carver is a laid-off construction worker, not housing contractor. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at         http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak     \nDonald Trump\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/us-job-losses-mount-economic-pain-deepens-worldwide-70181940", "title": "US job losses mount as Trump presses plan to reopen business", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 20:08:02 -0400", "summary": "The ranks of America&rsquo;s unemployed are swelling toward Great Depression-era levels", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_e184accad04b4125aa8e34f7c78564b8_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/epa-gutting-rule-credited-coal-plant-toxic-air-70189068": {"story": "WASHINGTON -- \nThe Trump administration on Thursday gutted an         Obama-era rule that compelled the country's coal plants to cut back emissions of mercury and other human health hazards, a move designed to limit future regulation of air pollutants from coal- and oil-fired power plants.\n\nEnvironmental Protection Agency chief Andrew Wheeler said the rollback was reversing what he depicted as regulatory overreach by the Obama administration. \u201cWe have put in place an honest accounting method that balances\u201d the cost to utilities with public safety, he said.\n\nWheeler  is a former coal lobbyist whose previous clients have gotten many of the         regulatory rollbacks they sought from the Trump administration.\n\nEnvironmental and public health groups and Democratic lawmakers faulted the administration for pressing forward with a series of rollbacks easing pollution rules for industry \u2014 in the final six months of President Donald Trump\u2019s current term \u2014 while the         coronavirus pandemic rivets the world\u2019s attention.\n\nWith rollbacks on air pollution protections, the \u201cEPA is all but ensuring that higher levels of harmful air pollution will make it harder for people to recover in the long run\u201d from the disease caused by the coronavirus, given the lasting harm the illness does to victims hearts and lungs, said Delaware Sen. Tom Carper, the senior Democrat on the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.\n\nThe EPA move leaves in place standards for emissions of mercury, which damages the developing brains of children and has has been linked to a series of other ailments. But the changes greatly reduce the health benefits that regulators can consider in crafting futures rules for power plant emissions. That undermines the 2011 mercury rule and limits regulators' ability to tackle the range of soot, heavy metals, toxic gases and other hazards from fossil fuel power plants.\n\nThe Trump administration contends the mercury cleanup was not \u201cappropriate and necessary,\u201d a legal benchmark under the country\u2019s landmark         Clean Air Act.     \n\nThe Obama rule led to what electric utilities say was an $18 billion cleanup of mercury and other toxins from the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants. EPA staffers\u2019 own analysis said the rule curbed mercury\u2019s devastating neurological damage to children and prevented thousands of premature deaths annually, among other public health benefits.\n\nMost coal-fired power plants have already made the technological upgrades required by the 2011 mercury rule. Many utilities have urged the Trump administration not to go ahead with Thursday's rollbacks, fearing expensive legal battles will result.\n\nFred Krupp, president of the Environmental Defense Fund advocacy group, said the Obama-era mercury standards already had proved to be \u201ca resounding success,\" reducing mercury pollution from coal plants by more than 80 percent. \u201cThanks to these vital clean air protections, we all have less poison in the air we breathe and the food we eat,\" Krupp said in a statement.\n\nCoal power plants in this country are the largest single manmade source of mercury pollutants, which enter the food chain through fish and other items that people consume.\n\nIn 2017, Wheeler, while still a lobbyist,         accompanied coal magnate Robert Murray on some of Murray's calls to new Trump Cabinet members. Murray was pushing a list of desired rollbacks of regulations on coal, as well as asking for major staffing cuts at the EPA and other changes at government boards.\n\nTrump and his administration have granted several of Murray's requests, including scrapping an Obama-era climate change effort that would have encouraged utilities to move to cleaner forms of energy than coal. \n\nFalling, and now plummeting, prices for natural gas and cheaper costs for solar and wind power have made it tough for coal-fired power plants in the U.S. marketplace, leading to drops in coal production and coal energy in the country despite Trump's rescue efforts.\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/epa-gutting-rule-credited-coal-plant-toxic-air-70189068", "title": "EPA guts rule credited with cleaning up coal-plant toxic air", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 20:07:56 -0400", "summary": "The Trump administration is gutting an Obama-era rule that compelled coal plants to cut back emissions of mercury and other human health hazards", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_07879606aa2246f59528f18e42d8636a_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/relief-check-govt-70189521": {"story": "\nAmericans are beginning to see the first economic impact payments hit their bank accounts. \n\nThe Treasury Department says about 80 million Americans received checks as of Wednesday. The one-time payments were approved by Congress as part of an emergency relief package intended to combat the economic damage from the \n pandemic. \n\nThe exact timing of when people get their money depends on a few factors, such as income and payment delivery method. \n\nHere is what you should expect:\n\nWHO IS GETTING A CHECK?\n\nAny adult earning up to $75,000 in adjusted gross income who has a valid Social Security number will receive a $1,200 payment. \n\nThe payment steadily declines for those who make more and phases out for those who earn more than $99,000. For married couples, both adults receive $1,200, with the phase-out starting at $150,000 of income and falling to zero for couples who earn $198,000. \n\nParents will also get payments of $500 for each eligible child; this is generally those 16 years old or younger. \n\nFor heads of household with one child, the benefit starts to decline at $112,500 and falls to zero at $136,500. \n\nEven those who only receive Social Security or other government benefit programs can receive a check. \n\nWHO DOESN\u2019T GET ONE?\n\nHigh-income filers are excluded, as is anyone without a valid Social Security number.\n\nIf someone can be claimed as a dependent on someone else\u2019s return, such as an adult child or student, they will not get a payment. \n\nPeople who are not a U.S. citizen, U.S. national and do not yet have a green card or have not met the IRS resident requirement known as \u201csubstantial presence test\" aren't eligible. People who filed Form 1040-PR or 1040-SS for 2019 are not eligible; these are IRS forms used for certain types of self-employment income in \n. \n\nWHAT DO I HAVE TO DO TO GET ONE?\n\nThe first batch of payments went to those taxpayers who included their direct deposit information on their 2018 or 2019 tax return.\n\nAs for others:\n\n\u2014 If you filed a tax return for 2018 or 2019 but didn't include you bank information, say because you owed \n, you can use the IRS' new \u201c         Get My Payment\u201d app to enter that information and receive your check via direct deposit. \n\n\u2014 If you didn't file a tax return for 2018 or 2019, the IRS urges you to file a return electronically as soon as possible in order to get your payment. \n\n\u2014 Social Security recipients and railroad retirees, who aren\u2019t typically required to file taxes, do not need to take action. The government will send your payment automatically to you either by check or direct deposit, however you typically get benefits. \n\n\u2014Low-income individuals or others who typically don\u2019t have to file a return, need to file a simple form on the IRS website for \u201c         non-filers \". Social Security recipients who have an eligible child can also use this form to get payment for that dependent as it is not automatically included in their relief payment. \n\nAnyone who doesn't supply direct deposit information will get their check in the mail. \n\nHOW LONG A WAIT? \n\nThe IRS says paper checks will begin going out later this month. \n\nIt's unclear how long it will take to complete the paper check distribution because many taxpayers are signing up for direct deposit. But a memo obtained earlier by The Associated Press said it could take several month for all the paper checks to be issued due to printing volume limitations. The Treasury and IRS have not said how long they expect the process to take. \n\nAll payments will be made based on income, with lower-income individuals receiving payment first. The IRS said the \u201cGet My Payment\u201d app will allow taxpayers to track the status of their payment. \n\nWILL I HAVE TO PAY BACK THE GOVERNMENT? \n\nVideos and reports have circulated claiming that Americans will have to pay back the relief checks on next year's taxes.\n\nThose reports are false, federal agencies confirmed to The Associated Press. \n\nBoth the U.S. Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service say these social media reports are misunderstanding language in the $2.2 trillion economic rescue package that resulted in the one-time payments. Americans won\u2019t be required to pay that money back come next year, the Treasury said. \n\nCAN IT BE TAKEN IF I OWE MONEY?\n\nIt can happen but not always. \n\nIf you owe back child support, the relief money can be taken to satisfy that debt. \n\nIf your bank account is overdrawn and the payment is deposited there, the bank can keep the deposit to satisfy the amount it is due, just as it would any normal deposit. However, a number of banks \u2014 including Bank of America, JPMorgan Chase, Citibank and Wells Fargo\u2014 have decided the relief payment will not have to go to negative balances or fees, according to a report by the New York Times. \n\nThere also is nothing in the CARES Act, the massive relief program that includes the payments, that protects them from private debt collectors. A debt collector must have a court judgment that allows them to come after that money, unless a state has opted to put a law in place to protect it. \n\nBE AWARE\n\nAdditionally, the IRS is urging people to be on the lookout for any scams related to the economic impact payments. \n\nThe IRS will not call, text, email or contact people via social media asking for personal or bank account information ever.

The fight over the line stretches back more than a decade after it became a lightning rod in the debate over fossil fuels\u2019 contribution to climate change.\n\n\u201cWith the rise of the pandemic, it is even more important to protect the tribe to at least put a pause on this activity, take hard look at this,\u201d said Matthew Campbell, an attorney for the Native American Rights Fund representing the Rosebud Sioux Tribe of South Dakota and the Assiniboine and Gros Ventre tribes of the Fort Belknap reservation in Montana.\n\nU.S. District Judge Brian Morris did not immediately rule following an almost four-hour hearing that also included arguments over whether President Donald's Trump's authorization of the border crossing was legal.\n\nTrump is a champion of the $8 billion project and gave it a presidential authorization last year in a bid to circumvent a 2018 court ruling from Morris that had blocked the project and prompted a new environmental review.\n\nLate Wednesday, Morris handed another setback to TC Energy with a ruling that invalidated a key U.S. Army Corps of Engineers clean water permit. The so-called nationwide permit applied to a broad range of projects including Keystone XL, and is needed to so the pipeline can cross rivers, streams and other waterways. \n\nKeystone XL would have hundreds of those crossings along its 1,200-mile (1,930 kilometer) route from Hardisty, Alberta to Steele City, Nebraska. It would carry up to 830,000 barrels (35 million gallons) of crude daily and opponents say a spill is inevitable.\n\nWorkers on Monday installed the first section of pipe across the U.S.-Canada border in northern Montana, according to court documents. Calgary-based TC Energy says it's taking steps to prevent any virus transmissions, including checking anyone entering work sites for symptoms and abiding by a 14-day quarantine for anyone who leaves Montana and returns.\n\nThe border crossing work does not require the Army Corps permit that was thrown out because there are no nearby waterways. But it's a major obstacle to any further work, and a company spokesman warned the judge's ruling has broad implications for projects across the U.S.\n\n\u201cThe ruling directly impacts various utilities constructing and maintaining infrastructure projects, including natural gas, liquids, television cable, electrical transmission, telephone, internet, among others,\" pipeline spokesman Terry Cunha said. \u201cThis decision hampers their ability to build or maintain infrastructure projects in wetlands and water bodies across the U.S.\"\n\nThe Army Corps referred questions to U.S. Justice Department spokesman Wyn Hornbuckle, who said government attorneys were evaluating options but provided no further details.\n\nTC Energy plans to drill tunnels for the pipeline deep beneath major river crossings and says it will be operated safely. The company has a history of spills from other oil pipelines it operates, including a 2017 accident near Amherst, South Dakota that spilled almost 10,000 barrels (407,000 gallons) of oil.\n\nTC Energy\u2019s surprise March 31 announcement that it planned to start construction on Keystone XL amid a global economic crisis caused by the coronavirus pandemic came after the provincial government in Alberta invested $1.1 billion to jump-start the work.\n\nTribal leaders and some residents of rural communities along the pipeline\u2019s route worry thousands of workers needed for the project could spread the virus in small communities that are unprepared. \n\nTC Energy wants to \u201cuse this construction as justification for allowing the project to proceed whether or not it is legal,\u201d the tribes' attorney said.\n\nAs many as 11 construction camps, some housing up to 1,000 people, were initially planned for the project. TC Energy says those are under review amid the pandemic and won\u2019t be needed until later in the summer. \n\nFor most people, the coronavirus causes mild or moderate symptoms, such as fever and cough, that clear up in two to three weeks. For some, especially older adults and people with existing health problems, it can cause more severe illness, including pneumonia and death. \n\nThe rural counties along the pipeline's route so far have seen far fewer infections than other parts of the U.S. But they lack adequate health care services to deal with a large outbreak. \n\nConstruction on two worker camps could start as soon as this month in Montana and South Dakota, according to court documents filed by the company.\n\nThe construction under way in Montana involves about 100 workers. It's exempted from Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock\u2019s March 26 \u201cstay at home\u201d directive, which is aimed at preventing the spread of the virus by discouraging many daily activities, according to state officials. \n\nThe directive did not address worker camps. Bullock spokeswoman Marissa Perry said the governor wants all coronavirus concerns addressed before TC Energy finalizes its plans in areas requiring camps.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Matthew Brown at https://twitter.com/matthewbrownap\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Business/wireStory/tribes-press-judge-halt-us-canada-pipeline-work-70188971", "title": "Tribes press judge to halt US-Canada pipeline as work starts", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 19:41:38 -0400", "summary": "Native American tribes and environmental groups are pressuring a federal judge to shut down work on the construction of an oil pipeline from Canada to Nebraska less than two weeks after it started", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/WireAP_0b5c65d64a9d4cd8b944710226439df7_16x9_992.jpg"}}, "science": {"https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/trump-aides-float-outlier-theory-origins-coronavirus-70193245": {"story": "WASHINGTON -- \nChina is pushing back against President \n and some of his officials, who\u2019ve flirted in recent days with an outlier theory that         the coronavirus was set loose by a Chinese lab that let it escape. \n\nThe Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman on Friday accused the U.S. administration of attempting to shift the focus from its own missteps in dealing with the pandemic by talking up a theory that it was started by a pathogen from a laboratory in Wuhan, the city where the global outbreak began.\n\nBut that spokesman, Zhao Lijian, has demonstrated that China, too, is not above sowing confusion in the face of the pandemic. He tweeted in March the falsehood that the virus might have come from the U.S. Army.\n\nA scientific consensus is still evolving, but the leading theory is that infection among humans began at an animal market in Wuhan, probably from an animal that got the virus from a bat.\n\nWithout the weight of evidence, Trump and some administration officials are trying to blame China for sickness and death from COVID-19 in the United States.\n\n\u201cMore and more, we\u2019re hearing the story,\u201d Trump says. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo adds, \u201cThe mere fact that we don\u2019t know the answers \u2014 that China hasn\u2019t shared the answers \u2014 I think is very, very telling.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Pompeo said the U.S. is pressing China to let outside experts into the lab \u201cso that we can determine precisely where this virus began.\u201d\n\nAsked on Fox Business Network about whether China might have manipulated the virus for sinister purposes, he said, \u201cIt is completely appropriate that the world ask the right questions,\u201d then diverted to another subject. \n\nTrump officials have largely been steering clear of baseless conspiracy theories in circulation that the virus was intentionally set loose by China, even as some give weight to the unsubstantiated idea the virus mistakenly spread from a negligent lab in Wuhan.\n\nExperts overwhelmingly say analysis of the new coronavirus\u2019s genome rules out the possibility that it was engineered by humans, as some commentators have suggested.\n\nNor is it likely that the virus emerged from a negligent laboratory in Wuhan, they say. \u201cI would put it on a list of 1,000 different scenarios,\u201d said Nathan Grubaugh of Yale University, who studies the epidemiology of microbial disease.\n\nScientists say the virus arose naturally in bats.\n\nEven so, Pompeo and others are pointing fingers at an institute that is run by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and has done groundbreaking research tracing the likely origins of the SARS virus, finding new bat viruses and discovering how they could jump to people.\n\n\u201cWe know that there is the Wuhan Institute of Virology just a handful of miles away from where the wet market was,\u201d Pompeo said. The institute has an address 8 miles, or 13 kilometers, from the market.\n\nU.S. officials say the American Embassy in Beijing flagged concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018, but stressed there's no evidence the virus originated there nearly two years later.\n\nThe episode shows that both world powers \u2014 the country where the virus originally spread and the country with the most sickness and deaths from it \u2014 are willing to use shaky theories and propaganda to divert attention from problems in their pandemic response. \n\nAt a briefing Friday, Zhao asserted that suspicions about the lab were generated by the U.S. \u201csimply to confuse the public, divert attention and shirk responsibility.\u201d He added: \u201cWe have said many times that tracing of the virus\u2019s origin is a serious scientific issue and requires scientific and professional assessment.\u201d\n\nYet on March 12, he tweeted: \u201cIt might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.. Be transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\u201d \n\nLea Gabrielle, head of the State Department\u2019s Global Engagement Center, said in late March that China was heavily pushing the fabrication that the virus came from the U.S., especially to its online audiences in Africa. China dropped the claim late that month because people weren't buying it.\n\nChina and the U.S. both wasted crucial time responding to the outbreak.\n\nMore than 3,000 people had been infected before China\u2019s government told the public what it had concluded         six days earlier \u2014 that a pandemic was probably coming.\n\nBeijing muffled early warnings, such that the Chinese were assured the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission was low even as infected people entered hospitals across the country and the first case outside China was found, in Thailand.\n\nThe United States, also late to take the threat seriously, has lagged a number of other countries in the thick of the pandemic when it comes to its response.\n\nTrump failed to live up to his early promises to have ample testing, a key factor in containing disease. The U.S. still struggles to supply hospitals, front-line workers and patients with necessities in a climate of confusion spilling into chaos. More than 670,000 people in the U.S. have been sickened with COVID-19, not counting large numbers whose illnesses are not being registered, and more than 33,000 have died, according to         figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the pressure for scapegoats is strong. \n\nAfter weeks of elaborate praise of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s performance in the pandemic, Trump has turned to blaming China and         halting U.S. contributions to the World Health Organization, accusing it of parroting misinformation from Beijing.\n\nIn the U.S., claims that the virus was created in or released from a Chinese lab emerged just weeks after the outbreak began and quickly spread from fringe internet sites to the wider public.\n\nThe reality is more mundane, said Dr. Gregory Poland, head of vaccine research at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \u201cThis virus is a typical bat coronavirus that has developed the capacity to infect other mammals, and bats are mammals, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s becoming evident is that the natural origin of this fits with the transmission dynamics and biology of it all.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that comments on Fox Business Network were by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, not Vice President Mike Pence. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Dake Kang in Beijing, Matthew Lee in Washington, David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island, Amanda Seitz in Chicago and Malcolm Ritter and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed.\nDonald Trump\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/trump-aides-float-outlier-theory-origins-coronavirus-70193245", "title": "China pushes back on Trump administration coronavirus theory", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 12:18:01 -0400", "summary": "China is pushing back against President Donald Trump and some of his officials on the question of how the new coronavirus began to infect humans", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_558f1ca863fa42609085fe6f34c2ad8d_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/iss-crew-lands-kazakhstan-200-days-70201238": {"story": "MOSCOW -- \nA U.S.-Russian crew landed safely Friday in the steppes of Kazakhstan following a stint on the International Space Station and was greeted with extra precautions due to the coronavirus.\n\nNASA astronauts Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan. and Russian cosmonaut Oleg Skripochka touched down as scheduled at 11:16 a.m. (0516 GMT) Friday.

The recovery team and medical personnel assigned to help the three out of the capsule and to perform post-flight checks were under close medical observation for nearly a month before the landing and were tested for the coronavirus.\n\nRoscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin said the three astronauts were feeling well.\n\nMorgan wrapped up a 272-day mission on his first flight into space. He conducted seven space walks, four of which were to improve and extend the life of the station\u2019s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which looks for evidence of dark matter in the universe.\n\nMeir and Skripochka spent 205 days in space, with Meir carrying out the first three all-women spacewalks with crewmate Christina Koch, who returned from space in February.\n\nThe crew members smiled as they talked to medical experts wearing masks.

As countries lift restrictions on movement, tracing whether someone has come into contact with an infected person will be key to allowing a return to normal life.\n\nThe use of such apps would do away with the need for the time-consuming, painstaking work involved in questioning people who have contracted the disease to try to work out where they picked it up.\n\nIn a new set of         guidelines, the European Commission says that public trust is paramount for the system to work because the apps are most effective when many people use them.\n\n\u201cSuch apps can only show their full potential if many people use them. Therefore, we want to give Europeans the trust in these apps,\u201d said commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental that the instillation and use of an app is voluntary.\u201d\n\nConcern is rife about the potentially invasive nature of tracking people\u2019s movements or the risk that their data might be shared with unknown authorities without their consent. In the past, European consumer groups have routinely warned about the privacy risks posed by using online \n devices.\n\nThe commission said the platforms should be managed by public \n authorities and dismantled once they are no longer needed. Their use should be voluntary, and no one should be punished for deciding not to download them.\n\nThe apps should function through Bluetooth wireless connections and work without any other mobile phone location services being activated.

The idea is to warn people when they have come close, and for a certain time, to someone who is infected, but not to log exactly where that contact might have taken place.\n\nThe apps should then provide advice about the best next steps, like whether to self-isolate, where to be tested and what to do to manage any symptoms. It could also allow patients to communicate with their doctors.\n\nWhile no single Europe-wide app is likely to be developed, the commission said it\u2019s important to align national systems given that many people commute to work in neighboring countries.\n\nThe Dutch government is organizing an online \u201cappathon\u201d over the weekend so that experts and members of the public can comment on apps being considered for use in the Netherlands to track and trace infections and report symptoms to health authorities.\n\nThe government is expected to announce next week whether or not to deploy the apps in its fight against the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Corder in The Hague contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at         http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak     \ncoronavirus\nhealth\nhealth\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/public-trust-key-eu-insists-developing-virus-apps-70203022", "title": "Public trust key, EU insists, in developing virus apps", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:33:03 -0400", "summary": "As European countries develop coronavirus tracing apps, the EU is urging them to make the platforms voluntary and ensure that the many national systems can work together", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/virginia-protest-gty-ps-200417_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/study-warming-makes-us-west-megadrought-worst-modern-70188982": {"story": "KENSINGTON, Maryland -- \nA two-decade-long dry spell that has parched much of the western United States is turning into one of the deepest megadroughts in the region in more than 1,200 years, a new study found.\n\nAnd about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal         Science. \n\nScientists looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico, plus a sliver of southwestern Montana and parts of northern Mexico. They used thousands of tree rings to compare a drought that started in 2000 and is still going \u2014 despite a wet 2019 \u2014 to four past megadroughts since the year 800. \n\nWith soil moisture as the key measurement, they found only one other drought that was as big and was likely slightly bigger. That one started in 1575, just 10 years after St. Augustine, the first European city in the United States, was founded, and that drought ended before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is \u201ca drought bigger than what modern society has seen,\u201d said study lead author         A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University.\n\nDaniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn\u2019t part of the study, called the research important because it provides evidence \u201cthat human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the \u2018megadroughts\u2019 of centuries past.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is that a natural but moderate drought is being worsened by temperatures that are 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit (1.6 degrees Celsius) hotter than the past and that suck moisture out of the ground, Williams said. It\u2019s much like how clothes and plants dry faster in the warmth of indoors than they do outside, he said.\n\nTo quantify the role of global warming, researchers used 31 computer models to compare what\u2019s happening now to what would happen in a mythical world without the burning of fossil fuels that spews billions of tons of heat-trapping gases. They found on average that 47% of the drought could be blamed on human-caused climate change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been increasingly drifting into a world that\u2019s getting dryer,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThere\u2019s debate among scientists over whether this current drought warrants the title \u201cmegadrought\u201d because so far it has only lasted two decades and others are at least 28 years long.\n\nClimate scientist Clara Deser at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who wasn\u2019t part of the study, said while the research is good, she thinks the deep drought has to last another decade or so to qualify as a \u201cmegadrought.\u201d \n\nWilliams said he understands the concern and that\u2019s why the study calls it \u201can emerging megadrought.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still going on and it\u2019s 21 years long,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis drought looks like one of the worst ones of the last millennium except for the fact that it hasn\u2019t lasted as long.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who studies southwestern climate and was not part of the study, calls it \u201cthe first observed multidecadal megadrought in recorded U.S. history.\u201d\n\nAlthough last year was wet, past megadroughts have had wet years and the recent rain and snow was not nearly enough to make up for the deep drought years before, Williams said.\n\nThe U.S.         drought monitor puts much of Oregon, California, Colorado, Utah and Nevada and good chunks of New Mexico, Arizona and Idaho in abnormally dry, moderate or severe drought conditions. Wyoming is the only state Williams studied that doesn\u2019t have large areas of drought. \n\nThis week, water managers         warned that the Rio Grande is forecast to have water flows less than half of normal, while New Mexico\u2019s largest reservoir is expected to top out at about one-third of its 30-year average.\n\nThis is \u201cwhat we can expect going forward in a world with continued global warming,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, who wasn\u2019t part of the study. \n\nRead more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at h         ttps://www.apnews.com/Climate     \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at         @borenbears .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives         support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

The institute has an address 8 miles, or 13 kilometers, from the market.\n\nU.S. officials say the American Embassy in Beijing did flag concerns about potential safety issues at the lab in Wuhan in 2018, but stressed there is no evidence that the virus originated there nearly two years later.\n\nThe episode shows that both world powers \u2014 the country where the virus originally spread and the country with the most sickness and deaths from it \u2014 are not above floating shaky theories and using propaganda to divert attention from problems in their pandemic response. China previously spread the falsehood that the virus started with Americans. \n\nChina and the U.S. both wasted crucial time responding to the outbreak.\n\nMore than 3,000 people had been infected before China\u2019s         government told the public what it had concluded six days earlier \u2014 that a pandemic was probably coming.\n\nBeijing muffled early warnings, such that the Chinese were assured the risk of sustained human-to-human transmission was low even as infected people entered hospitals across the country and the first case outside China was found, in Thailand.\n\nChinese leaders tried blaming the U.S., sharing Trump\u2019s habit of dressing up tweets with exclamation marks. \u201cIt might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan,\u201d China's foreign ministry spokesman, Zhao Lijian, tweeted on March 12. \u201cBe transparent! Make public your data! US owe us an explanation!\u201d China subsequently stopped promoting that fabrication internationally.\n\nThe United States,         also late to take the threat seriously, has lagged a number of other countries in the thick of the pandemic when it comes to its response.\n\nTrump failed to live up to his early promises to have ample testing, a key factor in containing disease. The U.S. still struggles to supply hospitals, front-line workers and patients with necessities in a climate of confusion spilling into chaos. More than 640,000 people in the U.S. have been sickened with COVID-19, not counting large numbers whose illnesses are not being registered, and more than 31,000 have died.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the pressure for scapegoats is strong. \n\nAfter weeks of elaborate praise of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s performance in the pandemic, Trump has turned to blaming China and halting U.S. contributions to the World Health Organization, accusing it of         parroting misinformation from Beijing.\n\nIn the U.S., claims that the virus was created in or released from a Chinese lab emerged just weeks after the outbreak began and quickly spread from fringe internet sites to the wider public, abetted by conspiracy theorists of every stripe.\n\nThe reality is more mundane, said Dr. Gregory Poland, head of vaccine research at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \u201cThis virus is a typical bat coronavirus that has developed the capacity to infect other mammals and bats are mammals, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s becoming evident is that the natural origin of this fits with the transmission dynamics and biology of it all.\u201d\n\nWhatever they think about the idea of a laboratory leak, Trump officials have not taken up the far-out theory that China might have created or released the virus through nefarious genetic engineering or ill intent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much faith that they\u2019re even being truthful with us now,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday on NBC's \u201cToday\u201d show. Yet, \u201ca majority of the views right now is that it is natural, it was organic,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s something of a diversion in a country wrestling with present danger, he seemed to suggest. \u201cOnce we get beyond the pandemic we\u2019ll have a chance to look back and really find out what happened.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Dake Kang in Beijing, Matthew Lee in Washington, David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island, Amanda Seitz in Chicago and Malcolm Ritter and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this report.\nDonald Trump\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/trump-aides-float-outlier-theory-origins-coronavirus-70193244", "title": "Trump, aides, float outlier theory on origins of coronavirus", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 16:53:43 -0400", "summary": "President Donald Trump and some of his officials are stepping up efforts to pin blame on China for the coronavirus pandemic", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_558f1ca863fa42609085fe6f34c2ad8d_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/apple-rolls-cheaper-iphone-pandemic-curbs-spending-70167484": {"story": "NEW YORK -- \nApple is releasing a new iPhone that will be vastly cheaper than the models it rolled out last fall when the economy was booming and the pandemic had yet to force people to rethink their spending.\n\nThe second-generation iPhone SE         introduced Wednesday  will sell for as little as $399, a 40% markdown from          the most affordable iPhone 11  unveiled last year. Higher-end versions of the iPhone 11 sell for more than $1,000. Online orders for the iPhone SE will begin Friday, with the first deliveries expected April 24.\n\nEven before the pandemic, many people had begun to balk at the substantial price tags for smartphones that weren't that much better than the ones they already owned. That pushed Apple to step up its emphasis on music and video services to the more than 1 billion people who carry around at least one of their internet-connected devices.\n\nHigh-priced gadgets are expected to become an even tougher sell as the economy plunges into its deepest downturn in more than a decade. \n\nApple maps out its products many months in advance and the new iPhone SE isn't a direct response to the economic meltdown hatched by the pandemic. Even though the iPhone SE will sell at a price that seems right for the tough times ahead, it is an extraordinarily difficult time to introduce a product, said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.\n\n\u201cApple faced a tough decision to make and ultimately decided to release and green light this smart phone to the market in hopes of gaining contained success out of the gates,\" Ives wrote.\n\nNew iPhones are typically released with much fanfare at a Silicon Valley theater named after Apple founder Steve Jobs, who revolutionized the market when he introduced the first iPhone in 2007. The springtime event never happened this year because of the pandemic.\n\nEven before the rapidly spreading \n forced most states to order lockdowns, Apple had been hit hard by efforts to contain it in China. Besides being its third largest market behind the U.S. and Europe, China is also where Apple makes most of its iPhones.\n\nWith both its factories and stores in China shut down for several weeks this year, Apple issued         a warning two months ago  that quarterly sales will fall short of previous projections. The Cupertino, California, company is scheduled to release its result for the quarter later this month.\n\nThe new iPhone SE is an update to another low-cost model that Apple released four years ago. Apple stopped selling the original iPhone SE in 2018.\n\nThe updated Phone SE is essentially the same as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which came out in 2017. The iPhone SE won't share the same displays and cameras carried by the newer iPhone 11 models. But it will be powered by the same A13 processing chip that's inside the more expensive iPhone 11. \n\nThe original iPhone SE was a hit with budget-conscious consumers, or those who preferred a smaller, 4-inch screen as newer phones grow increasingly large. The new model is slightly larger than the original, with a 4.7-inch screen.\n\nIn what could be another popular twist, the new iPhone SE brings back the home button. That's a notable change from the iPhone 11 line, which ditched the once-familiar button to accommodate larger screens that can handle the highest-quality video and photos. \n\nThe \n's ongoing worries about the pandemic eclipsed whatever enthusiasm investors could muster about a less-expensive iPhone helping to bolster Apple's sales in a depressed economy. The company's shares dipped $2.62 to close Wednesday at $284.43, leaving the stock 13% below its peak reached in late January,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNick Jesdanun reported this story from New York before he died of complications from COVID-19 on April 2.

But a scary bout of COVID-19 that began last month with headaches and fevers, progressed to breathing problems and led to a hospital visit has now left him eager to disclose as much as possible to help halt the virus\u2019 spread. \n\nKarosis has already shared personal details with Massachusetts \n investigators. And if he was asked to comply with a disease-tracking phone app that monitored his whereabouts but didn\u2019t publicly reveal his name and Cambridge street address, he said he\u2019d do that, too. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and I\u2019m under a quarantine -- hold me accountable for it,\u201d the 27-year-old software salesman said. \u201cYou have the potential to kill other people.\u201d\n\nAs countries around the world edge toward ending lockdowns and restarting their economies and societies, citizens are being more closely monitored, in nations rich and poor, authoritarian and free. \n\nNew systems to track who is infected and who isn\u2019t, and where they\u2019ve been, have been created or extended in China, South Korea and Singapore. And a range of other surveillance systems \u2013 some utilizing GPS location data, some gathering medical data \u2013 have been debated or piloted in Israel, Germany, the U.K., Italy and elsewhere. \n\nThe challenge: achieving the tricky balance between limiting the spread of disease and allowing people freedom to move outside their homes. \n\nWhether the prospect on the table is \u201cimmunity passports\u201d or cellphone-based tracking apps, the aim is to protect public \n. But experts say it\u2019s also important to avoid a slippery-slope scenario where data collected to minimize the spread of disease is stored indefinitely, available without limits to law enforcement or susceptible to hackers. \n\n\u201cWe need to build necessary guardrails for civil liberties,\u201d said Jake Laperruque, a lawyer at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight in Washington. \u201cIf new data is being collected for public health purposes, it should only be used for public health purposes.\u201d\n\nRight now, there is no single official plan for reopening the United States, where the constitutional system gives states responsibility for maintaining public safety and where deaths from COVID-19 continue to rise steeply.\n\nScientists believe that the hundreds of thousands of people who already have recovered from the virus worldwide are likely to have some immunity to future infection, but they aren\u2019t sure for how long. To ensure new cases don't overwhelm hospital capacity, any plans to relax lockdowns will include provisions to track infections. \n\n\u201cThe virus is not going away \u2013 if we all just come out on a certain date, it will spread widely again,\u201d said Dr. Tom Frieden, an infectious disease expert and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThat means we need to think carefully about how and when we come out.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the White House\u2019s top disease expert, said the administration has looked at the idea of issuing certificates of immunity to people whose blood tests reveal they have developed antibodies to fight the virus, among other possible plans. Yet they haven't concluded that approach would be effective, he         told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \n\n\u201cI know people are anxious to say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll give you a passport that says you\u2019re antibody-positive, you can go to work and you\u2019re protected.\u2019 The worst possibility that would happen is if we\u2019re actually wrong about that\u201d and those people get infected.\n\nMeanwhile, public health agencies from Massachusetts to the city of San Francisco have hired a surge of people to run \u201ccontact tracing\u201d teams. Their mission is to identify anyone who has recently been in contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, then encourage those people to get tested and perhaps isolate themselves. These meetings can be sensitive and require training, and support, to pull off effectively. \n\nAiming to take the tracing approach to a new scale are tech giants Apple and Google, which are jointly working to build smartphone technology that alerts users if they shared a park bench or grocery store aisle with a stranger later found to be infected with the virus. \n\nUnlike the more invasive location-tracking methods attempted by some governments, the Apple-Google approach uses Bluetooth beacons to detect physical proximity and encrypted keys to maintain people\u2019s anonymity. The companies say they\u2019re building the software for public health departments only, on the condition that they won\u2019t make use of them mandatory. \n\nIn addition to developing the technology, experts warn that the implications of deploying such devices need to be carefully considered. Who will collect and verify the data? How long will it be held? Will enough people use a voluntary app for it to be helpful?\n\n\u201cWe know from history that \u2018emergency measures\u2019 too often last long beyond their initial expiry date,\u201d said Deborah Brown, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. \n\nShe also noted that systems that monitor cellphone location or GPS data reveal more than just where someone has recently been. \u201cYour contacts and associations can be gleaned, potentially your religious or political beliefs,\u201d she said -- for instance, if you\u2019ve visited a church or mosque.\n\nSusan Landau, a cybersecurity professor at Tufts University, said she has doubts about the effectiveness of relying on smartphone-based approaches, even if the apps are carefully designed to protect individual privacy.\n\n\u201cMy real concern about the whole thing is I think it\u2019s being oversold,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes it reduce spread? I don\u2019t doubt that. Does it enable us to eliminate social distancing? No, not as long as there\u2019s a high portion of people who are asymptomatic.\u201d\n\nCollecting data should complement, but not substitute for, well-managed public health interventions, said Deborah Seligsohn, a political scientist at Villanova University. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to merely send a phone alert that someone exposed to a COVID-19 case should self-isolate for 14 days. It\u2019s another to have government workers bring them groceries or other essentials to make that quarantine period possible if someone would otherwise have trouble complying, she said.\n\nAfter the various lockdowns lift, it\u2019s not clear how readily Americans will submit to tracking efforts. \n\nCameron Karosis had his mind changed by contracting the virus, but many others are still wrestling with the prospect of how far they\u2019d be willing to go. \n\n\u201cPersonally, I would not be thrilled to be forced into downloading an app, mostly because I don\u2019t love the idea of Silicon Valley knowing even more about me than they already do,\u201d said Maura Cunningham, a writer in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \u201cBut I\u2019d probably give in on that pretty quickly if it were made a widespread prerequisite for getting back to normal activity at some point in the future. I\u2019d definitely resist a blood test \u2014 that just feels too intrusive.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

The closest approach occurred over the South Atlantic, with telescopes in Chile catching a glimpse of the speeding spacecraft. \n\nThe gravity tug from Earth slowed BepiColombo and put it on a course closer to the sun. \n\nIt was the first of nine planetary gravity assists \u2014 and the only one involving Earth \u2014 on the spacecraft\u2019s seven-year journey to Mercury. The spacecraft \u2014 comprised of two scientific orbiters \u2014 should reach Mercury in 2025, after swinging twice past Venus and six times past Mercury itself. The next flyby will be at Venus in October.\n\nBefore leaving Earth\u2019s vicinity, BepiColombo beamed back black-and-white pictures of the home planet. The spacecraft holds three GoPro-type cameras.\n\n\"These selfies from space are humbling, showing our planet, the common home that we share, in one of the most troubling and uncertain periods many of us have gone through,\u201d Gunther Hasinger, the European Space Agency's science director, said via Twitter.\n\nThe space agency's control center in Germany had fewer staff than usual for Friday's operation because of the coronavirus pandemic.

They joined two Americans and one \nn who will return to Earth in a week.\n\nThere was no social distancing 260 miles (420 kilometers) up: As they floated into the space station one by one, the new astronauts embraced the three already there. They had been in prelaunch quarantine for the past month.\n\nThe newest crew members will remain on board until October, keeping the outpost running until SpaceX launches a pair of NASA astronauts from Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, as early as next month. It will be the first orbital launch of astronauts from the U.S. since NASA\u2019s space shuttle program ended in 2011.\n\nThursday\u2019s liftoff was low-key even by Russian standards, given the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe. NASA televised the liftoff live as usual, but only a few Russia-based employees of the space agency were at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. \n\nCassidy\u2019s wife, Peggy, watched the launch from NASA\u2019s Mission Control in Houston. She returned home a few weeks ago, after saying goodbye to her husband at cosmonaut headquarters in Star City, Russia.\n\n\u201cNo virus is stronger than the human desire to explore,\u201d tweeted NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the entire @NASA and @roscosmos teams for their dedication to making this launch a success.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of liftoff, the astronauts said they felt fantastic after being in strict quarantine. The sparse crowds mostly stayed a safe distance from the astronauts; even the Orthodox priest offering the customary blessing stood several feet away.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019d love to have our families here with us, but it\u2019s what we understand we have to do to be safe,\u201d Cassidy said Wednesday. \u201cThe whole world is also impacted by the same crisis.\u201d\n\nAdded Ivanishin: \u201cWe\u2019ve been completely isolated at this final stage of training.\u201d\n\nThere was another twist, besides coronavirus: Ivanishin and Vagner were assigned to the flight just two months ago, after one of the original Russian crewmen suffered an eye injury.\n\nBecause of the late crew swap, Ivanishin and Vagner had no clothes waiting for them at the space station. They took a few extra outfits with them on the Soyuz, with more due to arrive on the next Russian supply ship later this month.\n\nOfficials from NASA and the Russian Space Agency were among only a few to address the astronauts, protected behind a glass wall, before they departed for the launch pad. The room normally is packed with family, friends and space program types; on Thursday, the rows of seats were almost all empty. Journalists were among those kept away.\n\n\u201cIt was a stunning launch and docking,\" NASA's Mission Control radioed from Houston after the crew arrived. \"And while we wish we had everyone to see you off from Baikonur, we know your family and friends, and your NASA family, were watching the whole way and couldn't be more proud.\"\n\n\u201cWe're just really happy to get here,\u201d replied Cassidy, a Navy captain.\n\nThis is the third spaceflight for Cassidy and Ivanishin, and the first for Vagner.\n\nAlready on board \u2014 and due to return to Earth on April 17 \u2014 are NASA\u2019s Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka.\n\nThe director of Roscosmos \u2014 Russia\u2019s space agency \u2014 said earlier this week that nine employees have tested positive for coronavirus. Roscosmos controls a sprawling network of production plants and launch facilities, and has about 200,000 employees, said director Dmitry Rogozin, who attended Thursday\u2019s launch.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIsachenkov contributed from Moscow.\nRussia\nRussia\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/us-russian-crew-blasts-off-international-space-station-70059706", "title": "US-Russian crew blasts off for International Space Station", "published": "Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:10:15 -0400", "summary": "Three astronauts have arrived at the International Space Station, after departing the virus-plagued planet", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_07c098aabbd7456696434131b1ca4618_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/virus-outbreak-delivers-tech-darlings-harsh-reality-check-70049475": {"story": "\nJust as the \n outbreak has boxed in society, it\u2019s also squeezed high-flying tech companies reliant on people\u2019s freedom to move around and get together.\n\nSince the beginning of March, for instance, \n shares have lost a quarter of their value. Rival Lyft is down 28 percent. Over the same period, the S&P 500 has fallen just 10 percent, even with wild swings along the way. The picture is even less clear for other, still-private \u201cunicorn\u201d companies once valued at more than $1 billion, such as Airbnb and WeWork.\n\n\u201cWhat market pressure will mean for all companies is survival of the fittest,\u201d said Allen Adamson, co-founder of the marketing firm Metaforce and a business professor at New York University. \u201cIf you are going into this storm in a bad shape, it\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d\n\nJust few weeks ago, Airbnb was poised to cash in on a soaring stock market with its highly anticipated public offering. But with the market now reeling and few people looking to anywhere but home, Airbnb is reportedly racking up         millions of dollars in losses while fending off a backlash from hosts who rely on its service to survive.\n\nHosts were furious when the company told guests they could cancel their stays without penalties. Last week, Airbnb agreed to pay hosts $250 million to make up for some of the money lost to cancellations.\n\nAirDNA, a data firm that helps property owners set rental rates, says the impact on U.S. Airbnb hosts has been mixed. In New York City, bookings dropped 66% in March, but in outer suburbs they were up as people fled the city. Bookings in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., jumped sixfold. Similarly, bookings in the city of Chicago fell 11% last month, but in St. Joseph, Michigan \u2014 a lakeside community within driving distance \u2014 they were up by a factor of four. \n\nCary Gillenwater, who has an attached guest suite in Amsterdam listed on Airbnb, said 20 guests have canceled reservations between March and June, costing him nearly $11,000. He had hoped for compensation from the company, but was told that only reservations canceled through Airbnb that specifically mentioned the coronavirus would qualify. Several of his would-be guests contacted him directly to cancel; he refunded their money, but may be out of luck when it comes to reimbursement. Airbnb said it was looking into the case..\n\nThe company got a lifeline of sorts on Monday, when two private equity firms \u2014 Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners \u2014 invested $1 billion in debt and equity in the company. The firms say the expect Airbnb to emerge from the crisis in a stronger position. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal         reported on Tuesday, however, that the company will pay interest of more than 10% on those loans and that it has made a \"verbal commitment\" to reduce fixed costs and to bring in supplemental management \u2014 terms that often mean layoffs and other cost-cutting. Airbnb didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Journal report.\n\nUber, meanwhile, is trying to reassure jittery investors than its aggressive expansion plans for ride-hailing remain on track. Like its rival Lyft, it has seen ride demand hit a wall as states ratchet up stay-at-home orders. Both companies are trying to conserve cash so they can weather the pandemic\u2019s fallout, in part by emphasizing deliveries of food and other goods.\n\nEven in its worst-case scenario -- an 80% decline in ridership through 2020 -- the company said it would end the year with $4 billion in cash. That would still mean burning through almost $7 billion this year, which could create problems for \n\u2019s larger ambitions such as self-driving cars and air taxis.\n\nAnalysts, however, remain largely bullish. \u201cWe believe both Uber and Lyft will come out the other side still well placed to capture growth and opportunity,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nDrivers are another story. San Diegan Christopher Chandler, who's been driving for both companies for two years, said he's lost more than 80% of his income since riders all but vanished. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to make some hard choices about what bills I won\u2019t pay this month,\" said Chandler, who has switched to deliveries that don't come close to covering his former ride income.\n\nOther lesser-known companies, however, have benefited from the pandemic. Zoom, the video conferencing provider, has seen its stock soar to new highs in recent weeks; shares have nearly quadrupled compared to their IPO price just 11 months ago. \n\nNot so long ago, the meal-kit maker Blue Apron was threatened with delisting from the New York Stock Exchange after its shares fell below the exchange minimum of $1. Since the beginning of March, however, company shares have more than tripled after it reported a sharp increase in consumer demand fueled by stay-at-home orders.\n\nCB Insights lists more than 450 startups worldwide valued at $1 billion or more. While it can be hard to paint these unicorns with a broad brush because of their variety of business models and leadership styles, co-founder and CEO Anand Sanwal said that what COVID-19 is doing to the economy will be \u201ctough for any company to weather, startup or not.\u201d\n\nSanwal said he\u2019s already seeing a decline in early-stage seed investments that help launch new tech startups. But he said investors who have poured big sums into unicorn startups will likely try to do what they can to help keep them healthy, at the very least by grooming them for sale rather than standing by as they collapse.\n\n\u201cInvestors are going to make some hard decisions about whether this is a temporary downturn, or a company that doesn\u2019t have a shot,\u201d he said. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Technology Writer Matt O\u2019Brien contributed to this story.\ncoronavirus\nUber\nUber\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/virus-outbreak-delivers-tech-darlings-harsh-reality-check-70049475", "title": "Virus outbreak delivers tech darlings a harsh reality check", "published": "Thu, 09 Apr 2020 13:09:18 -0400", "summary": "Just as the coronavirus outbreak has boxed in society, it&rsquo;s also squeezed high-flying tech companies reliant on people&rsquo;s freedom to move around and get together", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_07f9b9856c5c4791a9a91befb5c5d0c7_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/tie-game-ancient-bit-string-shows-neanderthal-handiwork-70065538": {"story": "NEW YORK -- \nIt looked like a white splotch on the underside of a Neanderthal stone tool. But a microscope showed it was a bunch of fibers twisted around each other.\n\nFurther examination revealed it was the first direct evidence that Neanderthals could make string, and the oldest known direct evidence for string-making overall, researchers say. \n\nThe find implies our evolutionary cousins had some understanding of numbers and the trees that furnished the raw material, they say. It's the latest discovery to show Neanderthals were smarter than modern-day people often assume.\n\nBruce Hardy, of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and colleagues report the discovery in a paper released Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports. The string hints at the possibility of other abilities, like making bags, mats, nets and fabric, they said. \n\nIt came from an archaeological site in the Rhone River valley of southeastern \n, and it's about 40,000 to 50,000 years old. Researchers don't know how Neanderthals used the string or even whether it had been originally attached to the stone cutting tool. \n\nMaybe the tool happened to fall on top of the string, preserving the quarter-inch (6.2 mm) segment while the rest perished over time, Hardy said. The string is about one-fiftieth of an inch (0.55 mm) wide. \n\nIt was made of fiber from the inner bark of trees. Neanderthals twisted three bundles of fibers together counterclockwise, and then twisted these bundles together clockwise to make the string. That assembly process shows some sense of numbers, Hardy said.\n\nPaola Villa, a Neanderthal expert at the University of Colorado Museum who was not involved in the new study, noted that Hardy had previously found \u201ctantalizing evidence\u201d for string-making by Neanderthals.

Even when their oxygen tank ruptured two days later \u2014 on April 13.\n\nJim Lovell and Fred Haise insist they\u2019re not superstitious. They even use 13 in their email addresses.\n\nAs mission commander Lovell sees it, he's incredibly lucky. Not only did he survive NASA\u2019s most harrowing moonshot, he\u2019s around to mark its golden anniversary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still alive. As long as I can keep breathing, I\u2019m good,\u201d Lovell, 92, said in an interview with The Associated Press from his Lake Forest, Illinois, home.\n\nA half-century later, Apollo 13 is still considered Mission Control\u2019s finest hour. \n\nLovell calls it \u201ca miraculous recovery.\u201d \n\nHaise, like so many others, regards it as NASA\u2019s most successful failure. \n\n\u201cIt was a great mission,\" Haise, 86, said. It showed \"what can be done if people use their minds and a little ingenuity.\u201d \n\nAs the lunar module pilot, Haise would have become the sixth man to walk on the moon, following Lovell onto the dusty gray surface. The oxygen tank explosion robbed them of the moon landing, which would have been NASA's third, nine months after Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took humanity's first footsteps on the moon.\n\nNow the coronavirus pandemic has robbed them of their anniversary celebrations. Festivities are on hold, including at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the mission began on April 11, 1970, a Saturday just like this year.\n\nThat won't stop Haise, who still lives in Houston, from marking what he calls \"boom day\u201d next Monday, as he does every April 13.\n\nLovell, Haise and Jack Swigert, a last-minute fill-in who died in 1982, were almost to the moon when they heard a bang and felt a shudder. One of two oxygen tanks had burst in the spacecraft's service module.\n\nThe tense words that followed are the stuff of space \u2014 and movie \u2014 fame.\n\n\u201cOK, Houston, we\u2019ve had a problem here,\u201d radioed Swigert, the command module pilot.\n\n\u201cThis is Houston. Say again, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cHouston, we\u2019ve had a problem,\u201d Lovell cut in.\n\nLovell reported a sudden voltage drop in one of the two main electrical circuits. Within seconds, Houston\u2019s Mission Control saw pressure readings for the damaged oxygen tank plunge to zero. The blast also knocked out two electrical power-generating fuel cells and damaged the third. \n\nAs Lovell peered out the window and saw oxygen escaping into the black void, he knew his moon landing was also slipping away. He shoved all emotions aside.\n\n\u201cNot landing on the moon or dying in space are two different things,\u201d Lovell explained, \u201cand so we forgot about landing on the moon. This was one of survival. How do we get home?\u201d\n\nThe astronauts were 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) from Earth. Getting back alive would require calm, skill and, yes, luck.\n\n\u201cThe explosion could not have happened at a better time,\u201d Lovell said.\n\nMuch earlier, he said, and the astronauts wouldn\u2019t have had enough electrical power to make it around the moon and slingshot back to Earth for a splashdown. A blast in lunar orbit or, worse still, while Lovell and Haise were on the surface, \u201cthat would be the end of it.\u201d \n\n\u201cI think we had some divine help in this flight,\u201d Lovell said.\n\nThe aborted mission went from being so humdrum that none of the major TV networks broadcast the astronauts\u2019 show-and-tell minutes before the explosion, to a life-and-death drama gripping the entire world. \n\nAs flight director Gene Kranz and his team in Houston raced to come up with a rescue plan, the astronauts kept their cool. It was Lovell\u2019s fourth spaceflight - his second to the moon - and the first and only one for Haise and Swigert.\n\nDark thoughts \u201calways raced through our minds, but silently. We didn\u2019t talk about that,\u201d Lovell said. \n\nAdded Haise: \u201cWe never hit the point where there was nothing left to do. So, no, we never got to a point where we said, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to die.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe White House, less confident, demanded odds. Kranz refused, leaving it to others to put the crew\u2019s chances at 50-50. In his mind, there was no doubt, no room for failure \u2014 only success.\n\n\u201cBasically that was the name of the game: I\u2019m going to get them home. My team\u2019s going to get them home. We will get them home,\" Kranz recalled.\n\nFor the record, Kranz never uttered \u201cfailure is not an option.\u201d The line is pure Hollywood, created for the 1995 movie \u201cApollo 13\u201d starring Ed Harris as Kranz and Tom Hanks as Lovell.\n\nThe flight controllers went into crisis mode. They immediately ordered the command module Odyssey shut down to conserve what little power remained, and the astronauts to move into the lunar module Aquarius, now a lifeboat. \n\nOne of the low points, Lovell said, was realizing they'd be cramped together in the lander.\n\n\u201cIt was designed for two people for two days. We were three people for four days.\u201d\n\nThe carbon dioxide overload, from breathing, threatened to kill them. \n\nEngineers scrambled to figure out how to convert the square air-purifying canisters in the dead capsule into round ones that would fit in their temporary home. \n\nTheir outside-the-box, seat-of-the-pants solution, using spacecraft scraps, worked. But it was so damp and cold that the astronauts couldn\u2019t sleep. Condensation covered the walls and windows, and the temperature was close to freezing.\n\nDehydrated and feverish, Haise had the roughest time during the six-day ordeal. Despite the sky-high stress, Haise recalls no cross words among the three test pilots. Even Swigert fit in, despite joining the crew a scant three days before liftoff. He replaced command module pilot Ken Mattingly, who with his crewmates had been exposed to German measles, but unlike them didn't have immunity. \n\nRumors swirled that the astronauts had poison pills tucked away in case of a hopeless situation. Lovell dispelled that notion on page one of his 1994 autobiography, \u201cLost Moon,\u201d the basis for the \u201cApollo 13\u2033 film.\n\nSplashdown day finally arrived April 17, 1970 \u2014 with no guarantees.\n\nThe astronauts managed to power up their command module, avoiding short circuits but creating a rainfall inside as the spacecraft decelerated in the atmosphere.\n\nThe communication blackout lasted 1 1/2 minutes longer than normal. Controllers grew alarmed. Finally, three billowing parachutes appeared above the Pacific. It was only then, Lovell said, that \u201cwe knew that we had it made.\u201d \n\nThe astronauts had no idea how much their cosmic cliffhanger impacted the world until they reached Honolulu. President Richard Nixon was there to greet them.\n\n\u201cWe never dreamed a billion people were following us on television and radio, and reading about us in banner headlines of every newspaper published,\u201d Lovell noted in a NASA history.\n\nThe tank explosion later was linked to damage caused by electrical overheating in ground tests. \n\nApollo 13 \u201cshowed teamwork, camaraderie and what NASA was really made of,\u201d said Columbia University\u2019s Mike Massimino, a former shuttle astronaut.\n\nIn the decades since, Lovell and his wife, Marilyn, of nearly 68 years have discussed the what-ifs and might-have-beens.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of everything is, naturally, that he\u2019s alive,\u201d she said, \u201cand that we\u2019ve had all these years.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

That would be the biggest cut in U.S. energy emissions since at least 1990, EIA records show. The year after the start of the 2008 recession saw a 7.3% decline.\n\nTrump routinely mocks the science of climate change, and his administration has moved to roll back tougher mileage and emissions standards and other climate efforts from the Obama administration. \n\nEmissions will fall markedly this year anyway, owing to the slowing economy and restrictions on business and travel related to the coronavirus, the EIA said.\n\nBurning of fossil fuels, and the rate of climate damage, typically rebounds as an economy does, after economic downturns.\n\nGlobally, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing radical declines in transportation emissions and drops in other sectors of the economy,\u201d said Stanford University\u2019s Rob Jackson, who heads a group of independent scientists who monitor global carbon pollution. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.\u201d \n\nThe energy agency projects Americans will burn 9% less gasoline and diesel and 10% less jet fuel, and that the electricity sector will generate 3% less power overall, among other declines. Solar and wind power \u2014 which get scant attention from Trump, other than his statements of loathing for wind turbines \u2014 will account for the majority of the country's new electricity generation, the report says. As marketplace competition reshapes how Americans get their energy, power plants will use 11% more renewables and 20% less coal this year.\n\nThe 2020 outlook also marks a setback in Trump's frequently stated mission of helping make the United States the world's dominant player in energy production. The coronavirus and an unrelated petroleum supply glut caused by ramped-up pumping by Saudi Arabia and Russia will return the United States to being a net importer of petroleum for at least a time, as domestic drilling subsides, the EIA report said.

The Council claimed Ferrari failed to sufficiently consult its scientists and too often sought to promote his own ideas instead of those of ERC. \n\nFerrari had been named for the job in May last year but only started his term on Jan. 1. His resignation had immediate effect.\n\nThe EU's executive Commission, which runs the day-to-day business of the 27-nation bloc, \u201cregrets the resignation of Professor Ferrari at this early stage in his mandate (...) and at these times of unprecedented crisis in which the role of EU research is key,\u201d spokesman Johannes Bahrke said. \n\nThe ERC promotes top research in the EU and boosts what it calls \u201cinvestigator-driven frontier research across all fields, on the basis of scientific excellence.\" It was set up in 2007 and runs on a 2 -billion-euro ($2.2-billion) annual budget. \n\nThe resignation was first announced by the Financial Times, based on a statement released to the paper by Ferrari, who said he had \u201cbeen extremely disappointed by the European response\u201d to the pandemic. \n\nFerrari complained about running into institutional and political obstacles as he sought to swiftly set up a scientific program to combat the virus.\n\n\u201cI have seen enough of both the governance of science, and the political operations at the European Union,\u201d he wrote in the statement. \u201cI have lost faith in the system itself.\u201d\n\nThe ERC council\u2019s vice president will assume the president\u2019s duties on an interim basis until the EU\u2019s chooses Ferrari\u2019s successor, Bahrke said.\n\nFerrari said that he would now return \u201cto the frontlines of the fight against Covid-19, with real resources and responsibilities, away from offices in Brussels, where my political skills are clearly inadequate,\" \n\nAs the coronavirus spread to Italy, Spain and other European nations, the EU was criticized for not acting forcefully enough to set up a coordinated response, although \n policy is primarily a responsibility of national governments. \n\nBahrke defended the EU\u2019s actions during the pandemic, saying the bloc has put forward \u201cthe most comprehensive package of measures combating the coronavirus.\u201d \n\nHe added that the ERC has been working on 50 different projects related to the new virus first identified in China late last year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\n361 words\n\nPublish Settings\ncoronavirus\nhealth\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/science-row-hits-eu-height-coronavirus-crisis-70044465", "title": "Science row hits EU at height of coronavirus crisis", "published": "Wed, 08 Apr 2020 12:15:49 -0400", "summary": "The European Union has been thrown into a scientific policy dispute at the height of the coronavirus crisis", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_4dd03a402e134f95a62215ddd3b2f5c3_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/twitters-dorsey-sets-1b-fund-consumers-breaks-70032789": {"story": "\nThe outbreak of the \n has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed.

Some companies have also recognized their         customers are suffering and extended a hand. \n\n\u2014 Allstate is sending shelter-in-place paybacks to customers, with most getting checks for 15% of their monthly premium in April and May. Auto and home owners customers with financial difficulties can delay two consecutive premium payments. Some will be allowed to pay what they can afford. The insurer is sending out $600 million to customers, according to a regulatory filing. \n\n\u2014 JPMorgan Chase has done away with minimum payment requirements on credit cards and it's waiving late fees. The bank will not report payment deferrals, such as late payments, to credit bureaus for up-to-date clients.\n\nJOBS FALLOUT: Few industries have been spared from mass layoffs, particularly manufacturers and restaurants         devastated  by social distancing. \n\n\u2014 BJ\u2019s Restaurants is laying off about 16,000 workers. \n\n\u2014 Nissan is furloughing about 10,000 workers as it extends a production suspension until at least April 27. \n\n\u2014 Honda will stop paying its roughly 14,400 production workers in Ohio, Indiana, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina as it extends a production shutdown through May 1. Workers are getting health insurance and other benefits.\n\n\u2014 Thousands of Spirit AeroSystems employees are being furloughed for three weeks without pay. Most managers and hourly employees at Spirit, Wichita\u2019s largest employer, will be placed on unpaid leave Wednesday. Spirit has been hammered by problems at Boeing and its troubled 737 Max aircraft. \n\n\u2014 T.J. Maxx's parent says it will be furloughing the majority of its hourly workers in its stores and distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada after Sunday. The company also operates such chains as Marshalls and HomeGoods. As of Feb. 1, TJX Cos. has a global workforce of 286,000, mostly in the U.S. That\u2019s more than double Macy\u2019s workforce.\n\nDORSEY'S FUND: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is setting aside $1 billion in stock to establish a philanthropic venture focused initially on global relief efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic. Dorsey, who is also CEO of the financial-payments startup Square, will bequeath the new venture shares from his Square holdings.\n\nDorsey announced the new venture, called Start Small, in a series of tweets, and said the contribution amounts to 28% of his fortune. The organization will disclose all transfers, sales and grants on a public Google Doc spreadsheet.\n\nStart Small won\u2019t be limited to COVID-19 work. \u201cOnce we have disarmed this pandemic,\u201d he wrote, the organization will shift its focus to girls\u2019 health and research into universal basic income, the idea that governments should guarantee a minimum income for all citizens.\n\nAIRLINES: A steep decline in travel has pushed airlines to cancel flights, run         fewer planes  and seek government aid. Some additional hurdles they have to contend with are rules governing the sector.\n\n\u2014 The Transportation Department gave smaller airlines a slight break in rules covering minimum service they must provide to get federal aid. The rules published Tuesday will let airlines drop flights to some airports if they serve one nearby. The department set more restrictive rules for the biggest four U.S. carriers \u2013 Delta, American, United and Southwest \u2013 to maintain flights.\n\n\u2014 United Airlines is cutting more flights in San Francisco and Los Angeles for at least three weeks because of falling demand for travel. United\u2019s president said last week the airline is losing $100 million a day.\n\nUNCONFIRMED: Misinformation and sketchy facts about the virus, and potential cures, are also         spreading fast. Of course, social media has become the conduit in many cases. \n\n\u2014 WhatsApp tightened restrictions on message forwarding to cut down on coronavirus-related misinformation. The Facebook company on Tuesday said users getting a \u201cfrequently forwarded\u201d message \u2014 one already shared by five or more people \u2014 will only be able to send it to one chat group at a time. \n\nWhatsApp said in a         blog post  that \u201cwe\u2019ve recently seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation.\u201d\n\nTESTING: There has been a lot of criticism over the failure in the U.S. to secure         widespread testing for the coronavirus. The volume remains far from what medical experts believe would provide a clear picture of the spread of the virus. But there are minor advances. \n\n\u2014 Walgreens is expanding COVID-19 drive-thru testing to 15 sites in seven states, up from just one last month. New locations are in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas, regions experiencing escalating rates of COVID-19. Walgreens expects to be able to test 3,000 people per day, beginning later this week.\n\nOIL PATCH: Crude prices have fallen almost 60% in the past three months and economists believe demand will be         severely clipped  by the virus and a global economy that was already slowing. \n\n\u2014 Exxon Mobil slashed capital spending for 2020 by 30%, a once unthinkable retreat for one of the world's biggest energy producers. The company said Tuesday that investments of $23 billion are anticipated in 2020, down from $33 billion.\n\nMARKETS: Markets have roiled for weeks because so much about the virus is unknown. \n\n\u2014 A big rally on Wall Street         vanished Tuesday. The S&P 500 ended 0.2% lower, retreating from a 3.5% earlier in the day. The gains faded as the price of U.S. crude oil abruptly went from a gain to a loss of more than 9%. \ncoronavirus\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/twitters-dorsey-sets-1b-fund-consumers-breaks-70032789", "title": "Twitter's Dorsey sets up $1B fund; consumers get some breaks", "published": "Sat, 11 Apr 2020 02:00:51 -0400", "summary": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is setting aside $1 billion in stock to establish a philanthropic venture focused initially on global relief efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_50a32214eaf941c7a0907f1fa3ba507e_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/bleaching-great-barrier-reef-widespread-70033520": {"story": "BRISBANE, Australia -- \nAn aerial survey of the Great Barrier Reef shows coral bleaching is sweeping across the area off the east of Australia for the third time in five years.\n\nBleaching has struck all three regions of the world\u2019s largest coral reef system and is more widespread than ever, scientists from James Cook University in Queensland state said Tuesday.\n\nThe air surveys of 1,036 reefs in the past two weeks found bleached coral in the northern, central and southern areas, James Cook University professor Terry Hughes said.\n\n\u201cAs summers grow hotter and hotter, we no longer need an El Nino event to trigger mass bleaching at the scale of the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cOf the five events we have seen so far, only 1998 and 2016 occurred during El Nino conditions.\u201d\n\nEl Nino is a climate pattern that starts with a band of warm ocean water in the central and east-central Pacific around the equator and affects global weather. \n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is made up of 2,900 separate reefs and 900 islands. It is unable to recover because there is not enough time between bleaching events.\n\n\u201cWe have already seen the first example of back-to-back bleaching \u2014 in the consecutive summers of 2016 and 2017,\u201d Hughes said, adding that the number of reefs spared from bleaching is shrinking as it becomes more widespread.\n\nHe said underwater surveys will be carried out later in the year to assess the extent of damage.\n\nIn early March, David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said the reef was facing a critical period of heat stress over the coming weeks following the most widespread coral bleaching the natural wonder has ever endured.\n\nThe authority, the government agency that manages the coral expanse off northeast Australia, said ocean temperatures over the next month would be crucial to how the reef recovers from heat-induced bleaching.\n\n\u201cThe forecasts ... indicate that we can expect ongoing levels of thermal stress for at least the next two weeks and maybe three or four weeks,\u201d Wachenfeld said in a weekly update on the reef\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cSo this still is a critical time for the reef and it is the weather conditions over the next two to four weeks that will determine the final outcome,\u201d he said.\n\nOcean temperatures across most of the reef were 0.5 to 1.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the March average.\n\nIn parts of the marine park in the south close to shore that avoided the ravages of previous bleachings, ocean temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above average.\n\nThe authority had received 250 reports of sightings of bleached coral due to elevated ocean temperatures during an unusually hot February.\n\nThe 345,400-square kilometer (133,360-square mile) World Heritage-listed colorful coral network has been devastated by four coral bleaching events since 1998.

It's almost certainly wrong. All models are wrong. Some are just less wrong than others \u2014 and those are the ones that public health officials rely on. \n\nWelcome to the grimace-and-bear-it world of modeling.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is that you want to know what\u2019s happening in the future,\u201d said NASA top climate modeler Gavin Schmidt. \u201cAbsent a time machine you\u2019re going to have to use a model.\u201d\n\nWeather forecasters use models. Climate scientists use them. Supermarkets use them. \n\nAs leaders try to get a handle on the coronavirus outbreak, they are turning to numerous mathematical models to help them figure out what might \u2014 key word, might \u2014 happen next and what they should try to do now to contain and prepare for the spread. \n\nThe model updated this week by the University of Washington \u2014 the one most often mentioned by U.S. health officials at White House briefings \u2014 predicts daily deaths in the U.S. will hit a peak in mid-April then decline through the summer.\n\nTheir         latest projection  shows that anywhere from 49,431 to 136,401 Americans will die in the first wave, which will last into the summer. That\u2019s a huge range of 87,000. But only a few days earlier the same team had a range of nearly 138,000, with 177,866 as the top number of deaths. Officials credit social distancing.\n\nThe latest calculations are based on better data on how the virus acts, more information on how people act and more cities as examples. For example, new data from Italy and Spain suggest social distancing is working even better than expected to stop the spread of the virus. \n\nThe time it took for the epidemic to peak \u2014 that is, for those deaths to start declining \u2014 was shorter in those Italian and Spanish cities than it was Wuhan, China, said Dr. Christopher Murray of the University of Washington, who developed the model. \n\nSo how does modeling work? Take everything we know about how the coronavirus is spreading, when it's deadly and when it's not, when symptoms show and when they don\u2019t. \n\nThen factor in everything we know about how people are reacting, social distancing, stay-at-home orders and other squishy human factors. \n\nNow add everything we know about testing, treating the disease and equipment shortages. Finally, mix in large dollops of uncertainty at every level.\n\nSqueeze all those thousands of data points into incredibly complex mathematical equations and voila, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen next with the pandemic. Except, remember, there\u2019s a huge margin of error: For the prediction of U.S. deaths, the range is larger than the population of Wilmington, Delaware.\n\n\u201cNo model is perfect, but most models are somewhat useful,\u201d said John Allen Paulos, a professor of math at Temple University and author of several books about math and everyday life. \"But we can\u2019t confuse the model with reality.\" \n\nOne challenge for modelers is dealing with seesawing death totals from overburdened public health departments. A state\u2019s data might show big swings in deaths \u2014 but only because a backlog of reports showed up all at once. The tremendous leaps in deaths in a single day could throw off predictions. \n\nAnother problem, said University of Texas disease modeler Lauren Ancel Meyers, is that most of the pandemic models, including hers, are based on how influenza acts, and that is different from this new coronavirus.\n\nMost models use calculus to factor in \u201cthings you can\u2019t predict,\u201d Meyers said. To her, they are simple equations, ones that a person who knows advanced calculus can figure out. To the rest of the world, it\u2019s Greek. Literally full of sigmas, phis, omegas and other symbols.\n\nEven with all of the uncertainty, \u201cit\u2019s much better than shooting from the hip,\u201d said Meyers, who is churning out iterations of what she calls a \u201cworkhorse model\u201d of COVID-19 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cData-driven models are the best evidence we have.\u201d\n\nBecause of the large fudge factor, it\u2019s smart not to look at one single number \u2014 the minimum number of deaths, or the maximum for that matter \u2014 but instead at the range of confidence, where there\u2019s a 95% chance reality will fall, mathematician Paulos said. For the University of Washington model, that's from 50,000 to 136,000 deaths.\n\nUncertainty will shrink with time, but never really go away \u2014 just like in hurricane forecasts, when the cone of uncertainty shrinks as the storm gets closer to making landfall, but remains large.\n\n\u201cUncertainty is the only certainty there is,\u201d Paulos said. \u201cAnd knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the University of Texas disease modeler to Lauren Ancel Meyers, not Lauren Meyer. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBorenstein reported from Kensington, Maryland.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives         support  from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut sought information about how the company handles users' personal data and guards against security threats and abuse.\n\nZoom has referred to trolls as \u201cparty crashers,\u201d which some critics have taken as a sign the company is downplaying the attacks.\n\nIn a statement issued last week, the company told The Associated Press it takes the security of meetings seriously and encourages users to report any incidents directly to Zoom. The company suggested that people hosting large, public meetings confirm that they are the only ones who can share their screen and use features like mute controls.\n\n\u201cFor those hosting private meetings, password protections are on by default, and we recommend that users keep those protections on to prevent uninvited users from joining,\u201d the company said. Zoom recently updated the default screen-sharing settings for education users so that teachers are by default the only ones who can share content.\n\nDespite the update, Nevada's Clark County School District, which includes all public schools in Las Vegas, and the New York City Department of Education, which is responsible for the largest school district in the U.S., have told teachers to stop using Zoom.\n\nZoom-bombing was always a threat given how the video conferencing app was configured \u2014 geared more toward user-friendliness than privacy, said Justin Brookman, director of privacy and technology policy at Consumer Reports.\n\nWhen shelter-at-home mandates suddenly converted Zoom into a lifeline for tens of millions of families, it became a juicy target for mischief, he said.\n\nFor years, \u201cthe usability issues outweighed the potential security issues because society was less reliant on them. Obviously, that has changed dramatically over the last month,\u201d Brookman added.\n\nSome Zoom-bombers have been able to randomly guess meeting IDs and crash conferences not configured to keep out interlopers, he said.\n\nIn other cases, inexperienced users have exposed meeting IDs online, including U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tweeted a screenshot of a Zoom Cabinet meeting that showed the ID and everyone\u2019s screen name.\n\nBrookman said Zoom can do more to boost privacy protections for a massive user base that now ranges from elementary school children to senior citizens discussing their wills with attorneys.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, including us, are critical of how they enable hosts to surveil users to make sure they are paying attention to the screen, or reading DMs or recording the call when it\u2019s not entirely clear,\" Brookman said.\n\nA mother in Georgia told a local TV station that her son was \u201cembarrassed and a little hysterical\u201d after someone hacked into his online class and showed pornography to the children and teacher.\n\nThe Rev. Jason Wells was holding a publicly advertised forum recently on Zoom when a troll entered and used the chat box to post a racial slur so many times that it made the feature unusable for other participants.\n\n\u201cI would not say this was a random vandal hoping to interrupt somebody,\u201d said Wells, who is executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches in Concord and co-chair of a state chapter of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, part of a movement pioneered by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The intruder was eventually removed and blocked.\n\nAs the Rev. Laura Everett delivered a sermon via Zoom for Boston\u2019s First Baptist Church, a user who had seen the church service advertised entered the video conferencing session and shouted homophobic and racist slurs. Everett said she had tweeted the link to the sermon because she wanted \u201cthe doors of the church to be open to every weary soul who is looking for a word of comfort.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was, for all intents and purposes, a house of worship that was violated,\" she said. \"Zoom and every other business bears the primary responsibility for users\u2019 safety.\u201d\n\nIn Oakland, California, Malachi Garza reported an attack on a Zoom conference she hosted for roughly 200 participants, including formerly incarcerated people who have experience with solitary confinement and are struggling with the pandemic\u2019s stay-home orders.\n\nThe conference organized by the philanthropic Solidare Network was interrupted by racist, anti-transgender language, and pornographic images were flashed on a shared screen. \n\nZoom needs to \u201ctell the truth and call this what it really is,\u201d Garza said. \u201cIt\u2019s racial terror, not party crashers.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMorrison reported from New York.

It said two workers who died had tested positive for the virus and another employee, who died of pneumonia, was suspected of having the infection.\n\nRussian officials said they took stringent measures to protect the crew members amid the pandemic. The recovery team and medical personnel assigned to help the three out of the capsule and to perform post-flight checks were under close medical observation for nearly a month before the landing and were tested for the coronavirus.\n\nRoscosmos director Dmitry Rogozin said the three astronauts were feeling well.\n\nMorgan wrapped up a 272-day mission on his first flight into space. He conducted seven space walks, four of which were to improve and extend the life of the station\u2019s Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer, which looks for evidence of dark matter in the universe.\n\nMeir and Skripochka spent 205 days in space, with Meir carrying out the first three all-women spacewalks with crewmate Christina Koch, who returned from space in February.\n\nThe crew members smiled as they talked to medical experts wearing masks.

From there, Skripochka will be taken to Moscow, while Morgan and Meir will be driven from Baikonur to Kyzylorda, 300 kilometers (190 miles) away, to board a NASA flight to Houston. \n\nRestrictions on international flights imposed by Kazakhstan required the long drive, said Vyacheslav Rogozhnikov, a Russian medical official who oversaw the crew\u2019s return.\n\n\u201cA 300-kilometer ride after landing is quite a load on the astronauts,\u201d he said, adding that Russia deployed its doctors to help the astronauts during the journey, if needed.\n\nSkripochka will spend three weeks under observation at a medical facility at the Star City cosmonaut training center outside Moscow, Russian space corporation Roscosmos said. Star City officials said the medical personnel monitoring him will wear hazmat suits to protect him from becoming infected with the new virus.\n\nOn Thursday, the Russian government coronavirus headquarters reported the first infection at the Star City, which serves as the main hub for pre-flight training of U.S., Russian and other international crew members of the International Space Station.

As countries lift restrictions on movement, tracing whether someone has come into contact with an infected person will be key to allowing a return to normal life.\n\nThe use of such apps would do away with the need for the time-consuming, painstaking work involved in questioning people who have contracted the disease to try to work out where they picked it up.\n\nIn a new set of         guidelines, the European Commission says that public trust is paramount for the system to work because the apps are most effective when many people use them.\n\n\u201cSuch apps can only show their full potential if many people use them. Therefore, we want to give Europeans the trust in these apps,\u201d said commission spokesman Johannes Bahrke. \u201cIt\u2019s fundamental that the instillation and use of an app is voluntary.\u201d\n\nConcern is rife about the potentially invasive nature of tracking people\u2019s movements or the risk that their data might be shared with unknown authorities without their consent. In the past, European consumer groups have routinely warned about the privacy risks posed by using online \n devices.\n\nThe commission said the platforms should be managed by public \n authorities and dismantled once they are no longer needed. Their use should be voluntary, and no one should be punished for deciding not to download them.\n\nThe apps should function through Bluetooth wireless connections and work without any other mobile phone location services being activated. Ideally, data would be protected by state-of-the-art encryption and only be kept as long as needed, the commission said.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t recommend to use personal location for this.

The idea is to warn people when they have come close, and for a certain time, to someone who is infected, but not to log exactly where that contact might have taken place.\n\nThe apps should then provide advice about the best next steps, like whether to self-isolate, where to be tested and what to do to manage any symptoms. It could also allow patients to communicate with their doctors.\n\nWhile no single Europe-wide app is likely to be developed, the commission said it\u2019s important to align national systems given that many people commute to work in neighboring countries.\n\nThe Dutch government is organizing an online \u201cappathon\u201d over the weekend so that experts and members of the public can comment on apps being considered for use in the Netherlands to track and trace infections and report symptoms to health authorities.\n\nThe government is expected to announce next week whether or not to deploy the apps in its fight against the spread of the coronavirus.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMike Corder in The Hague contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP coverage of the pandemic at         http://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and         https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak     \ncoronavirus\nhealth\nhealth\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/public-trust-key-eu-insists-developing-virus-apps-70203022", "title": "Public trust key, EU insists, in developing virus apps", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 07:33:03 -0400", "summary": "As European countries develop coronavirus tracing apps, the EU is urging them to make the platforms voluntary and ensure that the many national systems can work together", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/virginia-protest-gty-ps-200417_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/study-warming-makes-us-west-megadrought-worst-modern-70188982": {"story": "KENSINGTON, Maryland -- \nA two-decade-long dry spell that has parched much of the western United States is turning into one of the deepest megadroughts in the region in more than 1,200 years, a new study found.\n\nAnd about half of this historic drought can be blamed on man-made global warming, according to a study in Thursday\u2019s journal         Science. \n\nScientists looked at a nine-state area from Oregon and Wyoming down through California and New Mexico, plus a sliver of southwestern Montana and parts of northern Mexico. They used thousands of tree rings to compare a drought that started in 2000 and is still going \u2014 despite a wet 2019 \u2014 to four past megadroughts since the year 800. \n\nWith soil moisture as the key measurement, they found only one other drought that was as big and was likely slightly bigger. That one started in 1575, just 10 years after St. Augustine, the first European city in the United States, was founded, and that drought ended before the Pilgrims landed on Plymouth Rock in 1620.\n\nWhat\u2019s happening now is \u201ca drought bigger than what modern society has seen,\u201d said study lead author         A. Park Williams, a bioclimatologist at Columbia University.\n\nDaniel Swain, a UCLA climate scientist who wasn\u2019t part of the study, called the research important because it provides evidence \u201cthat human-caused climate change transformed what might have otherwise been a moderate long-term drought into a severe event comparable to the \u2018megadroughts\u2019 of centuries past.\u201d\n\nWhat\u2019s happening is that a natural but moderate drought is being worsened by temperatures that are 2.9 degrees Fahrenheit (1.6 degrees Celsius) hotter than the past and that suck moisture out of the ground, Williams said. It\u2019s much like how clothes and plants dry faster in the warmth of indoors than they do outside, he said.\n\nTo quantify the role of global warming, researchers used 31 computer models to compare what\u2019s happening now to what would happen in a mythical world without the burning of fossil fuels that spews billions of tons of heat-trapping gases. They found on average that 47% of the drought could be blamed on human-caused climate change.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been increasingly drifting into a world that\u2019s getting dryer,\u201d Williams said.\n\nThere\u2019s debate among scientists over whether this current drought warrants the title \u201cmegadrought\u201d because so far it has only lasted two decades and others are at least 28 years long.\n\nClimate scientist Clara Deser at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, who wasn\u2019t part of the study, said while the research is good, she thinks the deep drought has to last another decade or so to qualify as a \u201cmegadrought.\u201d \n\nWilliams said he understands the concern and that\u2019s why the study calls it \u201can emerging megadrought.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still going on and it\u2019s 21 years long,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThis drought looks like one of the worst ones of the last millennium except for the fact that it hasn\u2019t lasted as long.\u201d\n\nUniversity of Michigan environment dean Jonathan Overpeck, who studies southwestern climate and was not part of the study, calls it \u201cthe first observed multidecadal megadrought in recorded U.S. history.\u201d\n\nAlthough last year was wet, past megadroughts have had wet years and the recent rain and snow was not nearly enough to make up for the deep drought years before, Williams said.\n\nThe U.S.         drought monitor puts much of Oregon, California, Colorado, Utah and Nevada and good chunks of New Mexico, Arizona and Idaho in abnormally dry, moderate or severe drought conditions. Wyoming is the only state Williams studied that doesn\u2019t have large areas of drought. \n\nThis week, water managers         warned that the Rio Grande is forecast to have water flows less than half of normal, while New Mexico\u2019s largest reservoir is expected to top out at about one-third of its 30-year average.\n\nThis is \u201cwhat we can expect going forward in a world with continued global warming,\u201d said Stanford University climate scientist Noah Diffenbaugh, who wasn\u2019t part of the study. \n\nRead more stories on climate issues by The Associated Press at h         ttps://www.apnews.com/Climate     \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow Seth Borenstein on Twitter at         @borenbears .\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives         support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

More than 640,000 people in the U.S. have been sickened with COVID-19, not counting large numbers whose illnesses are not being registered, and more than 31,000 have died.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, the pressure for scapegoats is strong. \n\nAfter weeks of elaborate praise of Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s performance in the pandemic, Trump has turned to blaming China and halting U.S. contributions to the World Health Organization, accusing it of         parroting misinformation from Beijing.\n\nIn the U.S., claims that the virus was created in or released from a Chinese lab emerged just weeks after the outbreak began and quickly spread from fringe internet sites to the wider public, abetted by conspiracy theorists of every stripe.\n\nThe reality is more mundane, said Dr. Gregory Poland, head of vaccine research at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. \u201cThis virus is a typical bat coronavirus that has developed the capacity to infect other mammals and bats are mammals, too,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s becoming evident is that the natural origin of this fits with the transmission dynamics and biology of it all.\u201d\n\nWhatever they think about the idea of a laboratory leak, Trump officials have not taken up the far-out theory that China might have created or released the virus through nefarious genetic engineering or ill intent.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have much faith that they\u2019re even being truthful with us now,\u201d Defense Secretary Mark Esper said Thursday on NBC's \u201cToday\u201d show. Yet, \u201ca majority of the views right now is that it is natural, it was organic,\u201d he said.\n\nAnd it\u2019s something of a diversion in a country wrestling with present danger, he seemed to suggest. \u201cOnce we get beyond the pandemic we\u2019ll have a chance to look back and really find out what happened.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAssociated Press writers Dake Kang in Beijing, Matthew Lee in Washington, David Klepper in Providence, Rhode Island, Amanda Seitz in Chicago and Malcolm Ritter and Beatrice Dupuy in New York contributed to this report.\nDonald Trump\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/trump-aides-float-outlier-theory-origins-coronavirus-70193244", "title": "Trump, aides, float outlier theory on origins of coronavirus", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 16:53:43 -0400", "summary": "President Donald Trump and some of his officials are stepping up efforts to pin blame on China for the coronavirus pandemic", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_558f1ca863fa42609085fe6f34c2ad8d_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/apple-rolls-cheaper-iphone-pandemic-curbs-spending-70167484": {"story": "NEW YORK -- \nApple is releasing a new iPhone that will be vastly cheaper than the models it rolled out last fall when the economy was booming and the pandemic had yet to force people to rethink their spending.\n\nThe second-generation iPhone SE         introduced Wednesday  will sell for as little as $399, a 40% markdown from          the most affordable iPhone 11  unveiled last year. Higher-end versions of the iPhone 11 sell for more than $1,000. Online orders for the iPhone SE will begin Friday, with the first deliveries expected April 24.\n\nEven before the pandemic, many people had begun to balk at the substantial price tags for smartphones that weren't that much better than the ones they already owned. That pushed Apple to step up its emphasis on music and video services to the more than 1 billion people who carry around at least one of their internet-connected devices.\n\nHigh-priced gadgets are expected to become an even tougher sell as the economy plunges into its deepest downturn in more than a decade. \n\nApple maps out its products many months in advance and the new iPhone SE isn't a direct response to the economic meltdown hatched by the pandemic. Even though the iPhone SE will sell at a price that seems right for the tough times ahead, it is an extraordinarily difficult time to introduce a product, said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.\n\n\u201cApple faced a tough decision to make and ultimately decided to release and green light this smart phone to the market in hopes of gaining contained success out of the gates,\" Ives wrote.\n\nNew iPhones are typically released with much fanfare at a Silicon Valley theater named after Apple founder Steve Jobs, who revolutionized the market when he introduced the first iPhone in 2007. The springtime event never happened this year because of the pandemic.\n\nEven before the rapidly spreading \n forced most states to order lockdowns, Apple had been hit hard by efforts to contain it in China. Besides being its third largest market behind the U.S. and Europe, China is also where Apple makes most of its iPhones.\n\nWith both its factories and stores in China shut down for several weeks this year, Apple issued         a warning two months ago  that quarterly sales will fall short of previous projections. The Cupertino, California, company is scheduled to release its result for the quarter later this month.\n\nThe new iPhone SE is an update to another low-cost model that Apple released four years ago. Apple stopped selling the original iPhone SE in 2018.\n\nThe updated Phone SE is essentially the same as the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus, which came out in 2017. The iPhone SE won't share the same displays and cameras carried by the newer iPhone 11 models. But it will be powered by the same A13 processing chip that's inside the more expensive iPhone 11. \n\nThe original iPhone SE was a hit with budget-conscious consumers, or those who preferred a smaller, 4-inch screen as newer phones grow increasingly large. The new model is slightly larger than the original, with a 4.7-inch screen.\n\nIn what could be another popular twist, the new iPhone SE brings back the home button. That's a notable change from the iPhone 11 line, which ditched the once-familiar button to accommodate larger screens that can handle the highest-quality video and photos. \n\nThe \n's ongoing worries about the pandemic eclipsed whatever enthusiasm investors could muster about a less-expensive iPhone helping to bolster Apple's sales in a depressed economy. The company's shares dipped $2.62 to close Wednesday at $284.43, leaving the stock 13% below its peak reached in late January,\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nNick Jesdanun reported this story from New York before he died of complications from COVID-19 on April 2.

But a scary bout of COVID-19 that began last month with headaches and fevers, progressed to breathing problems and led to a hospital visit has now left him eager to disclose as much as possible to help halt the virus\u2019 spread. \n\nKarosis has already shared personal details with Massachusetts \n investigators. And if he was asked to comply with a disease-tracking phone app that monitored his whereabouts but didn\u2019t publicly reveal his name and Cambridge street address, he said he\u2019d do that, too. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick and I\u2019m under a quarantine -- hold me accountable for it,\u201d the 27-year-old software salesman said. \u201cYou have the potential to kill other people.\u201d\n\nAs countries around the world edge toward ending lockdowns and restarting their economies and societies, citizens are being more closely monitored, in nations rich and poor, authoritarian and free. \n\nNew systems to track who is infected and who isn\u2019t, and where they\u2019ve been, have been created or extended in China, South Korea and Singapore. And a range of other surveillance systems \u2013 some utilizing GPS location data, some gathering medical data \u2013 have been debated or piloted in Israel, Germany, the U.K., Italy and elsewhere. \n\nThe challenge: achieving the tricky balance between limiting the spread of disease and allowing people freedom to move outside their homes. \n\nWhether the prospect on the table is \u201cimmunity passports\u201d or cellphone-based tracking apps, the aim is to protect public \n. But experts say it\u2019s also important to avoid a slippery-slope scenario where data collected to minimize the spread of disease is stored indefinitely, available without limits to law enforcement or susceptible to hackers. \n\n\u201cWe need to build necessary guardrails for civil liberties,\u201d said Jake Laperruque, a lawyer at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight in Washington. \u201cIf new data is being collected for public health purposes, it should only be used for public health purposes.\u201d\n\nRight now, there is no single official plan for reopening the United States, where the constitutional system gives states responsibility for maintaining public safety and where deaths from COVID-19 continue to rise steeply.\n\nScientists believe that the hundreds of thousands of people who already have recovered from the virus worldwide are likely to have some immunity to future infection, but they aren\u2019t sure for how long. To ensure new cases don't overwhelm hospital capacity, any plans to relax lockdowns will include provisions to track infections. \n\n\u201cThe virus is not going away \u2013 if we all just come out on a certain date, it will spread widely again,\u201d said Dr. Tom Frieden, an infectious disease expert and former director of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cThat means we need to think carefully about how and when we come out.\u201d\n\nDr. Anthony Fauci, the White House\u2019s top disease expert, said the administration has looked at the idea of issuing certificates of immunity to people whose blood tests reveal they have developed antibodies to fight the virus, among other possible plans. Yet they haven't concluded that approach would be effective, he         told The Associated Press on Tuesday. \n\n\u201cI know people are anxious to say, \u2018Well, we\u2019ll give you a passport that says you\u2019re antibody-positive, you can go to work and you\u2019re protected.\u2019 The worst possibility that would happen is if we\u2019re actually wrong about that\u201d and those people get infected.\n\nMeanwhile, public health agencies from Massachusetts to the city of San Francisco have hired a surge of people to run \u201ccontact tracing\u201d teams. Their mission is to identify anyone who has recently been in contact with someone who tests positive for COVID-19, then encourage those people to get tested and perhaps isolate themselves. These meetings can be sensitive and require training, and support, to pull off effectively. \n\nAiming to take the tracing approach to a new scale are tech giants Apple and Google, which are jointly working to build smartphone technology that alerts users if they shared a park bench or grocery store aisle with a stranger later found to be infected with the virus. \n\nUnlike the more invasive location-tracking methods attempted by some governments, the Apple-Google approach uses Bluetooth beacons to detect physical proximity and encrypted keys to maintain people\u2019s anonymity. The companies say they\u2019re building the software for public health departments only, on the condition that they won\u2019t make use of them mandatory. \n\nIn addition to developing the technology, experts warn that the implications of deploying such devices need to be carefully considered. Who will collect and verify the data? How long will it be held? Will enough people use a voluntary app for it to be helpful?\n\n\u201cWe know from history that \u2018emergency measures\u2019 too often last long beyond their initial expiry date,\u201d said Deborah Brown, a senior researcher at Human Rights Watch. \n\nShe also noted that systems that monitor cellphone location or GPS data reveal more than just where someone has recently been. \u201cYour contacts and associations can be gleaned, potentially your religious or political beliefs,\u201d she said -- for instance, if you\u2019ve visited a church or mosque.\n\nSusan Landau, a cybersecurity professor at Tufts University, said she has doubts about the effectiveness of relying on smartphone-based approaches, even if the apps are carefully designed to protect individual privacy.\n\n\u201cMy real concern about the whole thing is I think it\u2019s being oversold,\u201d she said. \u201cDoes it reduce spread? I don\u2019t doubt that. Does it enable us to eliminate social distancing? No, not as long as there\u2019s a high portion of people who are asymptomatic.\u201d\n\nCollecting data should complement, but not substitute for, well-managed public health interventions, said Deborah Seligsohn, a political scientist at Villanova University. \n\nIt\u2019s one thing to merely send a phone alert that someone exposed to a COVID-19 case should self-isolate for 14 days. It\u2019s another to have government workers bring them groceries or other essentials to make that quarantine period possible if someone would otherwise have trouble complying, she said.\n\nAfter the various lockdowns lift, it\u2019s not clear how readily Americans will submit to tracking efforts. \n\nCameron Karosis had his mind changed by contracting the virus, but many others are still wrestling with the prospect of how far they\u2019d be willing to go. \n\n\u201cPersonally, I would not be thrilled to be forced into downloading an app, mostly because I don\u2019t love the idea of Silicon Valley knowing even more about me than they already do,\u201d said Maura Cunningham, a writer in Ann Arbor, Michigan. \u201cBut I\u2019d probably give in on that pretty quickly if it were made a widespread prerequisite for getting back to normal activity at some point in the future. I\u2019d definitely resist a blood test \u2014 that just feels too intrusive.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nO'Brien reported from Providence, Rhode Island.

The spacecraft holds three GoPro-type cameras.\n\n\"These selfies from space are humbling, showing our planet, the common home that we share, in one of the most troubling and uncertain periods many of us have gone through,\u201d Gunther Hasinger, the European Space Agency's science director, said via Twitter.\n\nThe space agency's control center in Germany had fewer staff than usual for Friday's operation because of the coronavirus pandemic. The ground controllers sat far apart as they monitored the flyby. Data from the flyby will be used to calibrate the spacecraft's science instruments.\n\nScientists hope to learn more about the origin and composition of Mercury, once the European and \nese orbiters separate and begin their own circling of the scorched planet. \n\nMercury is the least explored of our solar system's four rocky planets. It's just a little bigger than our moon and circles the sun in just 88 days.\n\nThe spacecraft is named after Italian mathematician and engineer Giuseppe \u201cBepi\u201d Colombo, who devised the use of planetary flybys for Mercury encounters. He died in 1984.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

They joined two Americans and one \nn who will return to Earth in a week.\n\nThere was no social distancing 260 miles (420 kilometers) up: As they floated into the space station one by one, the new astronauts embraced the three already there. They had been in prelaunch quarantine for the past month.\n\nThe newest crew members will remain on board until October, keeping the outpost running until SpaceX launches a pair of NASA astronauts from Florida\u2019s Kennedy Space Center, as early as next month. It will be the first orbital launch of astronauts from the U.S. since NASA\u2019s space shuttle program ended in 2011.\n\nThursday\u2019s liftoff was low-key even by Russian standards, given the coronavirus pandemic sweeping the globe. NASA televised the liftoff live as usual, but only a few Russia-based employees of the space agency were at the Baikonur Cosmodrome. \n\nCassidy\u2019s wife, Peggy, watched the launch from NASA\u2019s Mission Control in Houston. She returned home a few weeks ago, after saying goodbye to her husband at cosmonaut headquarters in Star City, Russia.\n\n\u201cNo virus is stronger than the human desire to explore,\u201d tweeted NASA Administrator Jim Bridenstine. \u201cI\u2019m grateful to the entire @NASA and @roscosmos teams for their dedication to making this launch a success.\u201d\n\nOn the eve of liftoff, the astronauts said they felt fantastic after being in strict quarantine. The sparse crowds mostly stayed a safe distance from the astronauts; even the Orthodox priest offering the customary blessing stood several feet away.\n\n\u201cObviously, we\u2019d love to have our families here with us, but it\u2019s what we understand we have to do to be safe,\u201d Cassidy said Wednesday. \u201cThe whole world is also impacted by the same crisis.\u201d\n\nAdded Ivanishin: \u201cWe\u2019ve been completely isolated at this final stage of training.\u201d\n\nThere was another twist, besides coronavirus: Ivanishin and Vagner were assigned to the flight just two months ago, after one of the original Russian crewmen suffered an eye injury.\n\nBecause of the late crew swap, Ivanishin and Vagner had no clothes waiting for them at the space station. They took a few extra outfits with them on the Soyuz, with more due to arrive on the next Russian supply ship later this month.\n\nOfficials from NASA and the Russian Space Agency were among only a few to address the astronauts, protected behind a glass wall, before they departed for the launch pad. The room normally is packed with family, friends and space program types; on Thursday, the rows of seats were almost all empty. Journalists were among those kept away.\n\n\u201cIt was a stunning launch and docking,\" NASA's Mission Control radioed from Houston after the crew arrived. \"And while we wish we had everyone to see you off from Baikonur, we know your family and friends, and your NASA family, were watching the whole way and couldn't be more proud.\"\n\n\u201cWe're just really happy to get here,\u201d replied Cassidy, a Navy captain.\n\nThis is the third spaceflight for Cassidy and Ivanishin, and the first for Vagner.\n\nAlready on board \u2014 and due to return to Earth on April 17 \u2014 are NASA\u2019s Jessica Meir and Andrew Morgan, and Russian Oleg Skripochka.\n\nThe director of Roscosmos \u2014 Russia\u2019s space agency \u2014 said earlier this week that nine employees have tested positive for coronavirus. Roscosmos controls a sprawling network of production plants and launch facilities, and has about 200,000 employees, said director Dmitry Rogozin, who attended Thursday\u2019s launch.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nIsachenkov contributed from Moscow.\nRussia\nRussia\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/us-russian-crew-blasts-off-international-space-station-70059706", "title": "US-Russian crew blasts off for International Space Station", "published": "Thu, 09 Apr 2020 15:10:15 -0400", "summary": "Three astronauts have arrived at the International Space Station, after departing the virus-plagued planet", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_07c098aabbd7456696434131b1ca4618_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/virus-outbreak-delivers-tech-darlings-harsh-reality-check-70049475": {"story": "\nJust as the \n outbreak has boxed in society, it\u2019s also squeezed high-flying tech companies reliant on people\u2019s freedom to move around and get together.\n\nSince the beginning of March, for instance, \n shares have lost a quarter of their value. Rival Lyft is down 28 percent. Over the same period, the S&P 500 has fallen just 10 percent, even with wild swings along the way. The picture is even less clear for other, still-private \u201cunicorn\u201d companies once valued at more than $1 billion, such as Airbnb and WeWork.\n\n\u201cWhat market pressure will mean for all companies is survival of the fittest,\u201d said Allen Adamson, co-founder of the marketing firm Metaforce and a business professor at New York University. \u201cIf you are going into this storm in a bad shape, it\u2019s not going to be pretty.\u201d\n\nJust few weeks ago, Airbnb was poised to cash in on a soaring stock market with its highly anticipated public offering. But with the market now reeling and few people looking to anywhere but home, Airbnb is reportedly racking up         millions of dollars in losses while fending off a backlash from hosts who rely on its service to survive.\n\nHosts were furious when the company told guests they could cancel their stays without penalties. Last week, Airbnb agreed to pay hosts $250 million to make up for some of the money lost to cancellations.\n\nAirDNA, a data firm that helps property owners set rental rates, says the impact on U.S. Airbnb hosts has been mixed. In New York City, bookings dropped 66% in March, but in outer suburbs they were up as people fled the city. Bookings in Westhampton Beach, N.Y., jumped sixfold. Similarly, bookings in the city of Chicago fell 11% last month, but in St. Joseph, Michigan \u2014 a lakeside community within driving distance \u2014 they were up by a factor of four. \n\nCary Gillenwater, who has an attached guest suite in Amsterdam listed on Airbnb, said 20 guests have canceled reservations between March and June, costing him nearly $11,000. He had hoped for compensation from the company, but was told that only reservations canceled through Airbnb that specifically mentioned the coronavirus would qualify. Several of his would-be guests contacted him directly to cancel; he refunded their money, but may be out of luck when it comes to reimbursement. Airbnb said it was looking into the case..\n\nThe company got a lifeline of sorts on Monday, when two private equity firms \u2014 Silver Lake and Sixth Street Partners \u2014 invested $1 billion in debt and equity in the company. The firms say the expect Airbnb to emerge from the crisis in a stronger position. \n\nThe Wall Street Journal         reported on Tuesday, however, that the company will pay interest of more than 10% on those loans and that it has made a \"verbal commitment\" to reduce fixed costs and to bring in supplemental management \u2014 terms that often mean layoffs and other cost-cutting. Airbnb didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment on the Journal report.\n\nUber, meanwhile, is trying to reassure jittery investors than its aggressive expansion plans for ride-hailing remain on track. Like its rival Lyft, it has seen ride demand hit a wall as states ratchet up stay-at-home orders. Both companies are trying to conserve cash so they can weather the pandemic\u2019s fallout, in part by emphasizing deliveries of food and other goods.\n\nEven in its worst-case scenario -- an 80% decline in ridership through 2020 -- the company said it would end the year with $4 billion in cash. That would still mean burning through almost $7 billion this year, which could create problems for \n\u2019s larger ambitions such as self-driving cars and air taxis.\n\nAnalysts, however, remain largely bullish. \u201cWe believe both Uber and Lyft will come out the other side still well placed to capture growth and opportunity,\u201d said Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nDrivers are another story. San Diegan Christopher Chandler, who's been driving for both companies for two years, said he's lost more than 80% of his income since riders all but vanished. \u201cI\u2019m going to have to make some hard choices about what bills I won\u2019t pay this month,\" said Chandler, who has switched to deliveries that don't come close to covering his former ride income.\n\nOther lesser-known companies, however, have benefited from the pandemic. Zoom, the video conferencing provider, has seen its stock soar to new highs in recent weeks; shares have nearly quadrupled compared to their IPO price just 11 months ago. \n\nNot so long ago, the meal-kit maker Blue Apron was threatened with delisting from the New York Stock Exchange after its shares fell below the exchange minimum of $1. Since the beginning of March, however, company shares have more than tripled after it reported a sharp increase in consumer demand fueled by stay-at-home orders.\n\nCB Insights lists more than 450 startups worldwide valued at $1 billion or more. While it can be hard to paint these unicorns with a broad brush because of their variety of business models and leadership styles, co-founder and CEO Anand Sanwal said that what COVID-19 is doing to the economy will be \u201ctough for any company to weather, startup or not.\u201d\n\nSanwal said he\u2019s already seeing a decline in early-stage seed investments that help launch new tech startups. But he said investors who have poured big sums into unicorn startups will likely try to do what they can to help keep them healthy, at the very least by grooming them for sale rather than standing by as they collapse.\n\n\u201cInvestors are going to make some hard decisions about whether this is a temporary downturn, or a company that doesn\u2019t have a shot,\u201d he said. \n\n\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Technology Writer Matt O\u2019Brien contributed to this story.\ncoronavirus\nUber\nUber\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/virus-outbreak-delivers-tech-darlings-harsh-reality-check-70049475", "title": "Virus outbreak delivers tech darlings a harsh reality check", "published": "Thu, 09 Apr 2020 13:09:18 -0400", "summary": "Just as the coronavirus outbreak has boxed in society, it&rsquo;s also squeezed high-flying tech companies reliant on people&rsquo;s freedom to move around and get together", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_07f9b9856c5c4791a9a91befb5c5d0c7_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/tie-game-ancient-bit-string-shows-neanderthal-handiwork-70065538": {"story": "NEW YORK -- \nIt looked like a white splotch on the underside of a Neanderthal stone tool. But a microscope showed it was a bunch of fibers twisted around each other.\n\nFurther examination revealed it was the first direct evidence that Neanderthals could make string, and the oldest known direct evidence for string-making overall, researchers say. \n\nThe find implies our evolutionary cousins had some understanding of numbers and the trees that furnished the raw material, they say. It's the latest discovery to show Neanderthals were smarter than modern-day people often assume.\n\nBruce Hardy, of Kenyon College in Gambier, Ohio, and colleagues report the discovery in a paper released Thursday by the journal Scientific Reports. The string hints at the possibility of other abilities, like making bags, mats, nets and fabric, they said. \n\nIt came from an archaeological site in the Rhone River valley of southeastern \n, and it's about 40,000 to 50,000 years old. Researchers don't know how Neanderthals used the string or even whether it had been originally attached to the stone cutting tool. \n\nMaybe the tool happened to fall on top of the string, preserving the quarter-inch (6.2 mm) segment while the rest perished over time, Hardy said. The string is about one-fiftieth of an inch (0.55 mm) wide. \n\nIt was made of fiber from the inner bark of trees. Neanderthals twisted three bundles of fibers together counterclockwise, and then twisted these bundles together clockwise to make the string. That assembly process shows some sense of numbers, Hardy said.\n\nPaola Villa, a Neanderthal expert at the University of Colorado Museum who was not involved in the new study, noted that Hardy had previously found \u201ctantalizing evidence\u201d for string-making by Neanderthals.

Even when their oxygen tank ruptured two days later \u2014 on April 13.\n\nJim Lovell and Fred Haise insist they\u2019re not superstitious. They even use 13 in their email addresses.\n\nAs mission commander Lovell sees it, he's incredibly lucky. Not only did he survive NASA\u2019s most harrowing moonshot, he\u2019s around to mark its golden anniversary.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m still alive. As long as I can keep breathing, I\u2019m good,\u201d Lovell, 92, said in an interview with The Associated Press from his Lake Forest, Illinois, home.\n\nA half-century later, Apollo 13 is still considered Mission Control\u2019s finest hour. \n\nLovell calls it \u201ca miraculous recovery.\u201d \n\nHaise, like so many others, regards it as NASA\u2019s most successful failure. \n\n\u201cIt was a great mission,\" Haise, 86, said. It showed \"what can be done if people use their minds and a little ingenuity.\u201d \n\nAs the lunar module pilot, Haise would have become the sixth man to walk on the moon, following Lovell onto the dusty gray surface. The oxygen tank explosion robbed them of the moon landing, which would have been NASA's third, nine months after Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin took humanity's first footsteps on the moon.\n\nNow the coronavirus pandemic has robbed them of their anniversary celebrations. Festivities are on hold, including at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, where the mission began on April 11, 1970, a Saturday just like this year.\n\nThat won't stop Haise, who still lives in Houston, from marking what he calls \"boom day\u201d next Monday, as he does every April 13.\n\nLovell, Haise and Jack Swigert, a last-minute fill-in who died in 1982, were almost to the moon when they heard a bang and felt a shudder. One of two oxygen tanks had burst in the spacecraft's service module.\n\nThe tense words that followed are the stuff of space \u2014 and movie \u2014 fame.\n\n\u201cOK, Houston, we\u2019ve had a problem here,\u201d radioed Swigert, the command module pilot.\n\n\u201cThis is Houston. Say again, please.\u201d\n\n\u201cHouston, we\u2019ve had a problem,\u201d Lovell cut in.\n\nLovell reported a sudden voltage drop in one of the two main electrical circuits. Within seconds, Houston\u2019s Mission Control saw pressure readings for the damaged oxygen tank plunge to zero. The blast also knocked out two electrical power-generating fuel cells and damaged the third. \n\nAs Lovell peered out the window and saw oxygen escaping into the black void, he knew his moon landing was also slipping away. He shoved all emotions aside.\n\n\u201cNot landing on the moon or dying in space are two different things,\u201d Lovell explained, \u201cand so we forgot about landing on the moon. This was one of survival. How do we get home?\u201d\n\nThe astronauts were 200,000 miles (322,000 kilometers) from Earth. Getting back alive would require calm, skill and, yes, luck.\n\n\u201cThe explosion could not have happened at a better time,\u201d Lovell said.\n\nMuch earlier, he said, and the astronauts wouldn\u2019t have had enough electrical power to make it around the moon and slingshot back to Earth for a splashdown. A blast in lunar orbit or, worse still, while Lovell and Haise were on the surface, \u201cthat would be the end of it.\u201d \n\n\u201cI think we had some divine help in this flight,\u201d Lovell said.\n\nThe aborted mission went from being so humdrum that none of the major TV networks broadcast the astronauts\u2019 show-and-tell minutes before the explosion, to a life-and-death drama gripping the entire world. \n\nAs flight director Gene Kranz and his team in Houston raced to come up with a rescue plan, the astronauts kept their cool. It was Lovell\u2019s fourth spaceflight - his second to the moon - and the first and only one for Haise and Swigert.\n\nDark thoughts \u201calways raced through our minds, but silently. We didn\u2019t talk about that,\u201d Lovell said. \n\nAdded Haise: \u201cWe never hit the point where there was nothing left to do. So, no, we never got to a point where we said, \u2018Well, we\u2019re going to die.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe White House, less confident, demanded odds. Kranz refused, leaving it to others to put the crew\u2019s chances at 50-50. In his mind, there was no doubt, no room for failure \u2014 only success.\n\n\u201cBasically that was the name of the game: I\u2019m going to get them home. My team\u2019s going to get them home. We will get them home,\" Kranz recalled.\n\nFor the record, Kranz never uttered \u201cfailure is not an option.\u201d The line is pure Hollywood, created for the 1995 movie \u201cApollo 13\u201d starring Ed Harris as Kranz and Tom Hanks as Lovell.\n\nThe flight controllers went into crisis mode. They immediately ordered the command module Odyssey shut down to conserve what little power remained, and the astronauts to move into the lunar module Aquarius, now a lifeboat. \n\nOne of the low points, Lovell said, was realizing they'd be cramped together in the lander.\n\n\u201cIt was designed for two people for two days. We were three people for four days.\u201d\n\nThe carbon dioxide overload, from breathing, threatened to kill them. \n\nEngineers scrambled to figure out how to convert the square air-purifying canisters in the dead capsule into round ones that would fit in their temporary home. \n\nTheir outside-the-box, seat-of-the-pants solution, using spacecraft scraps, worked. But it was so damp and cold that the astronauts couldn\u2019t sleep. Condensation covered the walls and windows, and the temperature was close to freezing.\n\nDehydrated and feverish, Haise had the roughest time during the six-day ordeal. Despite the sky-high stress, Haise recalls no cross words among the three test pilots. Even Swigert fit in, despite joining the crew a scant three days before liftoff. He replaced command module pilot Ken Mattingly, who with his crewmates had been exposed to German measles, but unlike them didn't have immunity. \n\nRumors swirled that the astronauts had poison pills tucked away in case of a hopeless situation. Lovell dispelled that notion on page one of his 1994 autobiography, \u201cLost Moon,\u201d the basis for the \u201cApollo 13\u2033 film.\n\nSplashdown day finally arrived April 17, 1970 \u2014 with no guarantees.\n\nThe astronauts managed to power up their command module, avoiding short circuits but creating a rainfall inside as the spacecraft decelerated in the atmosphere.\n\nThe communication blackout lasted 1 1/2 minutes longer than normal. Controllers grew alarmed. Finally, three billowing parachutes appeared above the Pacific. It was only then, Lovell said, that \u201cwe knew that we had it made.\u201d \n\nThe astronauts had no idea how much their cosmic cliffhanger impacted the world until they reached Honolulu. President Richard Nixon was there to greet them.\n\n\u201cWe never dreamed a billion people were following us on television and radio, and reading about us in banner headlines of every newspaper published,\u201d Lovell noted in a NASA history.\n\nThe tank explosion later was linked to damage caused by electrical overheating in ground tests. \n\nApollo 13 \u201cshowed teamwork, camaraderie and what NASA was really made of,\u201d said Columbia University\u2019s Mike Massimino, a former shuttle astronaut.\n\nIn the decades since, Lovell and his wife, Marilyn, of nearly 68 years have discussed the what-ifs and might-have-beens.\n\n\u201cThe outcome of everything is, naturally, that he\u2019s alive,\u201d she said, \u201cand that we\u2019ve had all these years.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

The year after the start of the 2008 recession saw a 7.3% decline.\n\nTrump routinely mocks the science of climate change, and his administration has moved to roll back tougher mileage and emissions standards and other climate efforts from the Obama administration. \n\nEmissions will fall markedly this year anyway, owing to the slowing economy and restrictions on business and travel related to the coronavirus, the EIA said.\n\nBurning of fossil fuels, and the rate of climate damage, typically rebounds as an economy does, after economic downturns.\n\nGlobally, \u201cwe\u2019re seeing radical declines in transportation emissions and drops in other sectors of the economy,\u201d said Stanford University\u2019s Rob Jackson, who heads a group of independent scientists who monitor global carbon pollution. \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen anything like this since the Great Depression.\u201d \n\nThe energy agency projects Americans will burn 9% less gasoline and diesel and 10% less jet fuel, and that the electricity sector will generate 3% less power overall, among other declines. Solar and wind power \u2014 which get scant attention from Trump, other than his statements of loathing for wind turbines \u2014 will account for the majority of the country's new electricity generation, the report says. As marketplace competition reshapes how Americans get their energy, power plants will use 11% more renewables and 20% less coal this year.\n\nThe 2020 outlook also marks a setback in Trump's frequently stated mission of helping make the United States the world's dominant player in energy production. The coronavirus and an unrelated petroleum supply glut caused by ramped-up pumping by Saudi Arabia and Russia will return the United States to being a net importer of petroleum for at least a time, as domestic drilling subsides, the EIA report said. Any global accord to cut back oil production could change that, the agency noted.\n\n\u201cThese trends are only temporary and they\u2019ll go away as fast as this coronavirus crisis goes away,\u201d said climate scientist Jonathan Overpeck, the University of Michigan\u2019s \n dean.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP Science Writer Seth Borenstein contributed to this report.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe story has been corrected to reflect that the University of Michigan\u2019s \n dean, not an Energy Department spokeswoman, said a drop in climate-changing emissions during the coronavirus outbreak would be temporary.\nDonald Trump\nenvironment\nenvironment\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/report-outbreak-triggers-drop-climate-changing-emissions-70030124", "title": "Report: Outbreak triggers drop in climate-changing emissions", "published": "Wed, 08 Apr 2020 13:18:02 -0400", "summary": "President Donald Trump will preside over one of America's sharpest drops in climate-changing emissions despite mocking the idea of climate change himself", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_3beea96513c54b4da0c362b8852f81dc_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/science-row-hits-eu-height-coronavirus-crisis-70044465": {"story": "BRUSSELS -- \nThe European Union has been thrown into a scientific policy dispute at the height of the \n crisis after the head of its top science panel resigned amid claims of red tape and institutional gridlock while other scientists at the group indicated that they were well rid of him.\n\nProfessor Mauro Ferrari resigned Tuesday as president of the European Research Council and insisted in a statement dramatically titled \u201cReturn to the frontlines, to the frontier\" that he had \u201clost faith in the system\" of the EU, complaining it was stifling his ambition for swift action on the pandemic.\n\nOn Wednesday though, the 19-member scientific council of the ERC said they had unanimously called on Ferrari to resign last month. The Council added in a statement that he \u201cdisplayed a complete lack of appreciation\" and \u201cdid not understand the context of\" the scientific group. The Council claimed Ferrari failed to sufficiently consult its scientists and too often sought to promote his own ideas instead of those of ERC. \n\nFerrari had been named for the job in May last year but only started his term on Jan. 1. His resignation had immediate effect.\n\nThe EU's executive Commission, which runs the day-to-day business of the 27-nation bloc, \u201cregrets the resignation of Professor Ferrari at this early stage in his mandate (...) and at these times of unprecedented crisis in which the role of EU research is key,\u201d spokesman Johannes Bahrke said. \n\nThe ERC promotes top research in the EU and boosts what it calls \u201cinvestigator-driven frontier research across all fields, on the basis of scientific excellence.\" It was set up in 2007 and runs on a 2 -billion-euro ($2.2-billion) annual budget. \n\nThe resignation was first announced by the Financial Times, based on a statement released to the paper by Ferrari, who said he had \u201cbeen extremely disappointed by the European response\u201d to the pandemic. \n\nFerrari complained about running into institutional and political obstacles as he sought to swiftly set up a scientific program to combat the virus.\n\n\u201cI have seen enough of both the governance of science, and the political operations at the European Union,\u201d he wrote in the statement. \u201cI have lost faith in the system itself.\u201d\n\nThe ERC council\u2019s vice president will assume the president\u2019s duties on an interim basis until the EU\u2019s chooses Ferrari\u2019s successor, Bahrke said.\n\nFerrari said that he would now return \u201cto the frontlines of the fight against Covid-19, with real resources and responsibilities, away from offices in Brussels, where my political skills are clearly inadequate,\" \n\nAs the coronavirus spread to Italy, Spain and other European nations, the EU was criticized for not acting forcefully enough to set up a coordinated response, although \n policy is primarily a responsibility of national governments. \n\nBahrke defended the EU\u2019s actions during the pandemic, saying the bloc has put forward \u201cthe most comprehensive package of measures combating the coronavirus.\u201d \n\nHe added that the ERC has been working on 50 different projects related to the new virus first identified in China late last year.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nFollow AP coverage of the virus outbreak at https://apnews.com/VirusOutbreak and https://apnews.com/UnderstandingtheOutbreak\n\n361 words\n\nPublish Settings\ncoronavirus\nhealth\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/science-row-hits-eu-height-coronavirus-crisis-70044465", "title": "Science row hits EU at height of coronavirus crisis", "published": "Wed, 08 Apr 2020 12:15:49 -0400", "summary": "The European Union has been thrown into a scientific policy dispute at the height of the coronavirus crisis", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Technology/WireAP_4dd03a402e134f95a62215ddd3b2f5c3_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/twitters-dorsey-sets-1b-fund-consumers-breaks-70032789": {"story": "\nThe outbreak of the \n has dealt a shock to the global economy with unprecedented speed. Following are developments Tuesday related to the global economy, the work place and the spread of the virus. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nCUSTOMERS FIRST: The pandemic is sapping trillions from the economy and the ramifications for businesses, from banks to restaurants, is severe. Some companies have also recognized their         customers are suffering and extended a hand. \n\n\u2014 Allstate is sending shelter-in-place paybacks to customers, with most getting checks for 15% of their monthly premium in April and May. Auto and home owners customers with financial difficulties can delay two consecutive premium payments. Some will be allowed to pay what they can afford. The insurer is sending out $600 million to customers, according to a regulatory filing. \n\n\u2014 JPMorgan Chase has done away with minimum payment requirements on credit cards and it's waiving late fees. The bank will not report payment deferrals, such as late payments, to credit bureaus for up-to-date clients.\n\nJOBS FALLOUT: Few industries have been spared from mass layoffs, particularly manufacturers and restaurants         devastated  by social distancing. \n\n\u2014 BJ\u2019s Restaurants is laying off about 16,000 workers. \n\n\u2014 Nissan is furloughing about 10,000 workers as it extends a production suspension until at least April 27. \n\n\u2014 Honda will stop paying its roughly 14,400 production workers in Ohio, Indiana, Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina as it extends a production shutdown through May 1. Workers are getting health insurance and other benefits.\n\n\u2014 Thousands of Spirit AeroSystems employees are being furloughed for three weeks without pay. Most managers and hourly employees at Spirit, Wichita\u2019s largest employer, will be placed on unpaid leave Wednesday. Spirit has been hammered by problems at Boeing and its troubled 737 Max aircraft. \n\n\u2014 T.J. Maxx's parent says it will be furloughing the majority of its hourly workers in its stores and distribution centers in the U.S. and Canada after Sunday. The company also operates such chains as Marshalls and HomeGoods. As of Feb. 1, TJX Cos. has a global workforce of 286,000, mostly in the U.S. That\u2019s more than double Macy\u2019s workforce.\n\nDORSEY'S FUND: Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is setting aside $1 billion in stock to establish a philanthropic venture focused initially on global relief efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic. Dorsey, who is also CEO of the financial-payments startup Square, will bequeath the new venture shares from his Square holdings.\n\nDorsey announced the new venture, called Start Small, in a series of tweets, and said the contribution amounts to 28% of his fortune. The organization will disclose all transfers, sales and grants on a public Google Doc spreadsheet.\n\nStart Small won\u2019t be limited to COVID-19 work. \u201cOnce we have disarmed this pandemic,\u201d he wrote, the organization will shift its focus to girls\u2019 health and research into universal basic income, the idea that governments should guarantee a minimum income for all citizens.\n\nAIRLINES: A steep decline in travel has pushed airlines to cancel flights, run         fewer planes  and seek government aid. Some additional hurdles they have to contend with are rules governing the sector.\n\n\u2014 The Transportation Department gave smaller airlines a slight break in rules covering minimum service they must provide to get federal aid. The rules published Tuesday will let airlines drop flights to some airports if they serve one nearby. The department set more restrictive rules for the biggest four U.S. carriers \u2013 Delta, American, United and Southwest \u2013 to maintain flights.\n\n\u2014 United Airlines is cutting more flights in San Francisco and Los Angeles for at least three weeks because of falling demand for travel. United\u2019s president said last week the airline is losing $100 million a day.\n\nUNCONFIRMED: Misinformation and sketchy facts about the virus, and potential cures, are also         spreading fast. Of course, social media has become the conduit in many cases. \n\n\u2014 WhatsApp tightened restrictions on message forwarding to cut down on coronavirus-related misinformation. The Facebook company on Tuesday said users getting a \u201cfrequently forwarded\u201d message \u2014 one already shared by five or more people \u2014 will only be able to send it to one chat group at a time. \n\nWhatsApp said in a         blog post  that \u201cwe\u2019ve recently seen a significant increase in the amount of forwarding which users have told us can feel overwhelming and can contribute to the spread of misinformation.\u201d\n\nTESTING: There has been a lot of criticism over the failure in the U.S. to secure         widespread testing for the coronavirus. The volume remains far from what medical experts believe would provide a clear picture of the spread of the virus. But there are minor advances. \n\n\u2014 Walgreens is expanding COVID-19 drive-thru testing to 15 sites in seven states, up from just one last month. New locations are in Arizona, Florida, Illinois, Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and Texas, regions experiencing escalating rates of COVID-19. Walgreens expects to be able to test 3,000 people per day, beginning later this week.\n\nOIL PATCH: Crude prices have fallen almost 60% in the past three months and economists believe demand will be         severely clipped  by the virus and a global economy that was already slowing. \n\n\u2014 Exxon Mobil slashed capital spending for 2020 by 30%, a once unthinkable retreat for one of the world's biggest energy producers. The company said Tuesday that investments of $23 billion are anticipated in 2020, down from $33 billion.\n\nMARKETS: Markets have roiled for weeks because so much about the virus is unknown. \n\n\u2014 A big rally on Wall Street         vanished Tuesday. The S&P 500 ended 0.2% lower, retreating from a 3.5% earlier in the day. The gains faded as the price of U.S. crude oil abruptly went from a gain to a loss of more than 9%. \ncoronavirus\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/twitters-dorsey-sets-1b-fund-consumers-breaks-70032789", "title": "Twitter's Dorsey sets up $1B fund; consumers get some breaks", "published": "Sat, 11 Apr 2020 02:00:51 -0400", "summary": "Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey is setting aside $1 billion in stock to establish a philanthropic venture focused initially on global relief efforts for the COVID-19 pandemic", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Business/WireAP_50a32214eaf941c7a0907f1fa3ba507e_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/bleaching-great-barrier-reef-widespread-70033520": {"story": "BRISBANE, Australia -- \nAn aerial survey of the Great Barrier Reef shows coral bleaching is sweeping across the area off the east of Australia for the third time in five years.\n\nBleaching has struck all three regions of the world\u2019s largest coral reef system and is more widespread than ever, scientists from James Cook University in Queensland state said Tuesday.\n\nThe air surveys of 1,036 reefs in the past two weeks found bleached coral in the northern, central and southern areas, James Cook University professor Terry Hughes said.\n\n\u201cAs summers grow hotter and hotter, we no longer need an El Nino event to trigger mass bleaching at the scale of the Great Barrier Reef,\u201d Hughes said. \u201cOf the five events we have seen so far, only 1998 and 2016 occurred during El Nino conditions.\u201d\n\nEl Nino is a climate pattern that starts with a band of warm ocean water in the central and east-central Pacific around the equator and affects global weather. \n\nThe Great Barrier Reef is made up of 2,900 separate reefs and 900 islands. It is unable to recover because there is not enough time between bleaching events.\n\n\u201cWe have already seen the first example of back-to-back bleaching \u2014 in the consecutive summers of 2016 and 2017,\u201d Hughes said, adding that the number of reefs spared from bleaching is shrinking as it becomes more widespread.\n\nHe said underwater surveys will be carried out later in the year to assess the extent of damage.\n\nIn early March, David Wachenfeld, chief scientist at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, said the reef was facing a critical period of heat stress over the coming weeks following the most widespread coral bleaching the natural wonder has ever endured.\n\nThe authority, the government agency that manages the coral expanse off northeast Australia, said ocean temperatures over the next month would be crucial to how the reef recovers from heat-induced bleaching.\n\n\u201cThe forecasts ... indicate that we can expect ongoing levels of thermal stress for at least the next two weeks and maybe three or four weeks,\u201d Wachenfeld said in a weekly update on the reef\u2019s health.\n\n\u201cSo this still is a critical time for the reef and it is the weather conditions over the next two to four weeks that will determine the final outcome,\u201d he said.\n\nOcean temperatures across most of the reef were 0.5 to 1.5 degrees Celsius (0.9 to 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) above the March average.\n\nIn parts of the marine park in the south close to shore that avoided the ravages of previous bleachings, ocean temperatures were 2 to 3 degrees Celsius (3.6 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) above average.\n\nThe authority had received 250 reports of sightings of bleached coral due to elevated ocean temperatures during an unusually hot February.\n\nThe 345,400-square kilometer (133,360-square mile) World Heritage-listed colorful coral network has been devastated by four coral bleaching events since 1998.

It's almost certainly wrong. All models are wrong. Some are just less wrong than others \u2014 and those are the ones that public health officials rely on. \n\nWelcome to the grimace-and-bear-it world of modeling.\n\n\u201cThe key thing is that you want to know what\u2019s happening in the future,\u201d said NASA top climate modeler Gavin Schmidt. \u201cAbsent a time machine you\u2019re going to have to use a model.\u201d\n\nWeather forecasters use models. Climate scientists use them. Supermarkets use them. \n\nAs leaders try to get a handle on the coronavirus outbreak, they are turning to numerous mathematical models to help them figure out what might \u2014 key word, might \u2014 happen next and what they should try to do now to contain and prepare for the spread. \n\nThe model updated this week by the University of Washington \u2014 the one most often mentioned by U.S. health officials at White House briefings \u2014 predicts daily deaths in the U.S. will hit a peak in mid-April then decline through the summer.\n\nTheir         latest projection  shows that anywhere from 49,431 to 136,401 Americans will die in the first wave, which will last into the summer. That\u2019s a huge range of 87,000. But only a few days earlier the same team had a range of nearly 138,000, with 177,866 as the top number of deaths. Officials credit social distancing.\n\nThe latest calculations are based on better data on how the virus acts, more information on how people act and more cities as examples. For example, new data from Italy and Spain suggest social distancing is working even better than expected to stop the spread of the virus. \n\nThe time it took for the epidemic to peak \u2014 that is, for those deaths to start declining \u2014 was shorter in those Italian and Spanish cities than it was Wuhan, China, said Dr. Christopher Murray of the University of Washington, who developed the model. \n\nSo how does modeling work? Take everything we know about how the coronavirus is spreading, when it's deadly and when it's not, when symptoms show and when they don\u2019t. \n\nThen factor in everything we know about how people are reacting, social distancing, stay-at-home orders and other squishy human factors. \n\nNow add everything we know about testing, treating the disease and equipment shortages. Finally, mix in large dollops of uncertainty at every level.\n\nSqueeze all those thousands of data points into incredibly complex mathematical equations and voila, here\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen next with the pandemic. Except, remember, there\u2019s a huge margin of error: For the prediction of U.S. deaths, the range is larger than the population of Wilmington, Delaware.\n\n\u201cNo model is perfect, but most models are somewhat useful,\u201d said John Allen Paulos, a professor of math at Temple University and author of several books about math and everyday life. \"But we can\u2019t confuse the model with reality.\" \n\nOne challenge for modelers is dealing with seesawing death totals from overburdened public health departments. A state\u2019s data might show big swings in deaths \u2014 but only because a backlog of reports showed up all at once. The tremendous leaps in deaths in a single day could throw off predictions. \n\nAnother problem, said University of Texas disease modeler Lauren Ancel Meyers, is that most of the pandemic models, including hers, are based on how influenza acts, and that is different from this new coronavirus.\n\nMost models use calculus to factor in \u201cthings you can\u2019t predict,\u201d Meyers said. To her, they are simple equations, ones that a person who knows advanced calculus can figure out. To the rest of the world, it\u2019s Greek. Literally full of sigmas, phis, omegas and other symbols.\n\nEven with all of the uncertainty, \u201cit\u2019s much better than shooting from the hip,\u201d said Meyers, who is churning out iterations of what she calls a \u201cworkhorse model\u201d of COVID-19 for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. \u201cData-driven models are the best evidence we have.\u201d\n\nBecause of the large fudge factor, it\u2019s smart not to look at one single number \u2014 the minimum number of deaths, or the maximum for that matter \u2014 but instead at the range of confidence, where there\u2019s a 95% chance reality will fall, mathematician Paulos said. For the University of Washington model, that's from 50,000 to 136,000 deaths.\n\nUncertainty will shrink with time, but never really go away \u2014 just like in hurricane forecasts, when the cone of uncertainty shrinks as the storm gets closer to making landfall, but remains large.\n\n\u201cUncertainty is the only certainty there is,\u201d Paulos said. \u201cAnd knowing how to live with insecurity is the only security.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the name of the University of Texas disease modeler to Lauren Ancel Meyers, not Lauren Meyer. \n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nBorenstein reported from Kensington, Maryland.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nThe Associated Press Health and Science Department receives         support  from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute\u2019s Department of Science Education.

Someone parroted her words. Then Britney Spears music came on, and someone told Weber to shut up. Someone threatened to rape her.\n\nHackers had targeted the meeting on the video conference platform Zoom while Weber was completing the final step of her doctoral degree at Duke University. The harassment lasted 10 minutes \u2014 the result of an increasingly common form of cyber attack known as \u201cZoom bombing.\u201d\n\nAs tens of millions of people turn to video conferencing to stay connected during the coronavirus pandemic, many have reported uninvited guests who make threats, interject racist, anti-gay or anti-Semitic messages, or show pornographic images. The attacks have drawn the attention of the FBI and other law enforcement agencies.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like someone was just being silly,\" but then the intrusions \"started to get more serious and threatening,\" Weber recalled. \u201cI was really in the zone and kept presenting.\" She said she was more concerned about others in the chat who could have been scared. She was interrupted despite having selected \u201cmute all\u201d in the settings for the meeting she conducted from her home in Durham, North Carolina.\n\nA Massachusetts high school reported that someone interrupted a virtual class on Zoom, yelled profanity and revealed the teacher\u2019s home address. Another school in that state reported a person who accessed a meeting and showed swastika tattoos, according to the FBI.\n\nThe agency's field office in Boston recommended that users of video-teleconference platforms prioritize their security by ensuring that hosts have sole control over screen-sharing features and meeting invitations.\n\nIn New York, Attorney General Letitia James sent a letter to Zoom with questions about how users' privacy and security are being protected. In a separate later, Sen. Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut sought information about how the company handles users' personal data and guards against security threats and abuse.\n\nZoom has referred to trolls as \u201cparty crashers,\u201d which some critics have taken as a sign the company is downplaying the attacks.\n\nIn a statement issued last week, the company told The Associated Press it takes the security of meetings seriously and encourages users to report any incidents directly to Zoom. The company suggested that people hosting large, public meetings confirm that they are the only ones who can share their screen and use features like mute controls.\n\n\u201cFor those hosting private meetings, password protections are on by default, and we recommend that users keep those protections on to prevent uninvited users from joining,\u201d the company said. Zoom recently updated the default screen-sharing settings for education users so that teachers are by default the only ones who can share content.\n\nDespite the update, Nevada's Clark County School District, which includes all public schools in Las Vegas, and the New York City Department of Education, which is responsible for the largest school district in the U.S., have told teachers to stop using Zoom.\n\nZoom-bombing was always a threat given how the video conferencing app was configured \u2014 geared more toward user-friendliness than privacy, said Justin Brookman, director of privacy and technology policy at Consumer Reports.\n\nWhen shelter-at-home mandates suddenly converted Zoom into a lifeline for tens of millions of families, it became a juicy target for mischief, he said.\n\nFor years, \u201cthe usability issues outweighed the potential security issues because society was less reliant on them. Obviously, that has changed dramatically over the last month,\u201d Brookman added.\n\nSome Zoom-bombers have been able to randomly guess meeting IDs and crash conferences not configured to keep out interlopers, he said.\n\nIn other cases, inexperienced users have exposed meeting IDs online, including U.K. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who tweeted a screenshot of a Zoom Cabinet meeting that showed the ID and everyone\u2019s screen name.\n\nBrookman said Zoom can do more to boost privacy protections for a massive user base that now ranges from elementary school children to senior citizens discussing their wills with attorneys.\n\n\u201cA lot of people, including us, are critical of how they enable hosts to surveil users to make sure they are paying attention to the screen, or reading DMs or recording the call when it\u2019s not entirely clear,\" Brookman said.\n\nA mother in Georgia told a local TV station that her son was \u201cembarrassed and a little hysterical\u201d after someone hacked into his online class and showed pornography to the children and teacher.\n\nThe Rev. Jason Wells was holding a publicly advertised forum recently on Zoom when a troll entered and used the chat box to post a racial slur so many times that it made the feature unusable for other participants.\n\n\u201cI would not say this was a random vandal hoping to interrupt somebody,\u201d said Wells, who is executive director of the New Hampshire Council of Churches in Concord and co-chair of a state chapter of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign, part of a movement pioneered by the Rev.

Organizers say they are planning for the festival to return in July 2021.\n\nThe annual confab was scheduled to take place from July 23 through July 26 in and around the San Diego Convention Center.

So why is CNN airing it?\n\nThe moment intensified a debate over how much unfiltered airtime the president should get virtually every day during a pandemic.\n\nThe coverage is a moving target, with CNN and MSNBC taking a more critical approach lately. Yet despite on-air talent like Rachel Maddow, Don Lemon, Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough suggesting they'd pull the plug if it were up to them, their bosses have given no indication that they will.\n\nEach day, the decisions are also being played out in newsrooms across the country.\n\n\u201cJournalists have long taken pride in their gatekeeping role, selecting from each day's many developments those that are most deserving of the public's attention and presenting them in a way that helps citizens understand what's at issue,\u201d said Thomas Patterson, professor of government and the press at Harvard University.\n\n\u201cIndiscriminate coverage of the president's press conferences sullies this tradition,\u201d he said. \u201cOne is left to wonder why. Is it ratings? Is it fear of Trump's wrath? It certainly is not journalism.\u201d\n\nIt's not so simple for the news executives making the call.\n\nWhen Trump began the briefings, they were undeniably news. Yet the events evolved beyond health updates to give some journalists the sense they're being used. Three markers stand out: the March 30 parade of corporate executives, including a pillow manufacturer praising the president; the April 1 discussion of drug smuggling by law enforcement officials; and Monday's video, a seeming response to newspaper investigations that were critical of Trump's early actions during the crisis.\n\nThe White House generally gives no guidance before each day's briefings on what Trump plans to address, although the president offered a day's notice about Thursday's announcement of a back-to-work plan.\n\nA network can choose not to cover Trump live. But what if he strides to the podium and instantly makes news \u2014 declares a day the country should reopen, for instance \u2014 and your rivals are showing it while you aren't?\n\n\u201cThe instinct to go live to important people in the middle of important stories is pretty deeply embedded,\u201d said Mark Lukasiewicz, a former NBC News executive now dean of Hofstra University\u2019s School of Communication.\n\nThe risk that misinformation will be spread in the middle of a health emergency now is so great that the networks curb those natural inclinations, he said.\n\n\u201cAll of us should stop broadcasting,\u201d MSNBC's Maddow said last month. \u201cIt\u2019s going to cost lives.\u201d\n\nTop cable executives wouldn't talk for attribution about their decision-making process since the situation is so fluid.\n\n\u201cWe are using our news judgment when it comes to these briefing events to navigate them as best we can to make sure our viewers have the news and they have the news with context,\u201d said one.\n\nIt's a day-to-day decision, said another.\n\nRecently, CNN and MSNBC have kept analysts on standby during live briefings, and dip out for fact checks or if they feel the subject has gotten too far afield. \n\n\u201cWe are going to avoid airing anymore of this briefing until it returns to what it was supposed to be, which was the coronavirus task force providing medical information,\u201d MSNBC\u2019s Ari Melber said during at a cutaway on Monday.\n\nCNN provides counterpoints with sharply-worded on-air chyrons at the bottom of the screens. One said Wednesday: \u201cTrump Again Falsely Claims He Has Right to Override Governors\u2019 Decisions on Social Restrictions.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s effective at all,\u201d Hofstra\u2019s Lukasiewicz said. \u201cThe misstatements are too frequent and too complex to be effectively fact-checked in the moment. It\u2019s a very hard exercise to do.\u201d\n\nFox News Channel, its audience dominated by Trump supporters, usually carries Trump in full \u2014 unless he bleeds into Tucker Carlson's prime-time show.\n\nTom Jones, analyst at the Poynter journalism think tank, said he believes journalists should not shield Trump from the public.\n\n\u201cWhile Trump\u2019s press conferences might occasionally be dangerous and divisive, not showing them would be irresponsible,\u201d he said.\n\nHis exception would be if briefings conflict with national or local news programs on broadcast network or their affiliates, which lately they've done. ABC, CBS and NBC have stopped airing the briefings, yet stream them online and give local affiliates the option to air them if they wish.\n\nWith Thursday's announcement of a plan for reopening the country, network affiliates in New Orleans; Chicago;, Charlotte, North Carolina; Richmond, Virginia; and Louisville, Kentucky all showed at least some of Trump's session.\n\n\u201cA lot to digest,\u201d anchor Debra Morgan of WRAL-TV in Raleigh, North Carolina, after breaking away from Trump after a half hour.\n\nAs Trump has boasted, the briefings are successful in the ratings, although that's the case for virtually all news programming lately. During the last two weeks, Fox News has drawn nearly 5 million viewers in the hours between 5 p.m. and 8 p.m., when the briefings are usually held. CNN (2.2 million) is up 204% over the same period a year ago and MSNBC (1.9 million) is up 47%.\n\nCable executives would face political blowback if they abandon the briefings. CNN's Oliver Darcy reported that Vice President Mike Pence's office for several days blocked administration health experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci from appearing as guests on the network because the briefings were not aired in full.\n\nAny decision to stop live airing the briefings will almost certainly come from top executives like Warner Media News and Sports Chairman Jeff Zucker or NBC News Chairman Andy Lack.\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/air-air-trump-briefings-pressure-networks-70210701", "title": "To air or not air Trump briefings?

Suing her high school to take the field on the varsity team (she lost). Notoriety as one of the first female NCAA baseball players.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until the smooth-fielding infielder made the roster as an extra in the Penny Marshall-directed movie \u201c         A League of Their Own \u201d that she realized she wasn\u2019t so alone. \n\nThere may be no crying in baseball, but there certainly are trailblazers. \n\nCroteau was introduced to the world of the         All-American Girls Professional Baseball League, which was featured in the 1992 film starring Geena Davis, Madonna and         Tom Hanks. The film was voted No. 10 in The Associated Press Top 25 favorite sports movies poll.\n\n\u201cTo see their part of history come alive in this movie, it truly was a gift,\u201d said the 49-year-old Croteau, who\u2019s now the director of communications for wellness programs at Stanford University. \u201cTo know that I wasn\u2019t alone. Because I felt like I was alone.\u201d\n\nCroteau was 20 when she showed up on the movie set that Marshall made sure was full of actors and extras who actually resembled ball players.\n\nNo worries with Croteau, who was already carving out her place in hardball history.\n\nGrowing up in rural Virginia, Croteau wanted more than anything to be a left-handed shortstop in the majors. Coaches pointed out that left-handers don\u2019t play shortstop in the majors. \n\nSo she moved to first base \u2014 and kept the same dream. \n\nCroteau made national news in the late 1980s when she sued her high school in Manassas, Virginia, to allow her to play. The court ultimately ruled she had received a fair tryout.\n\n\u201cI remember when we lost our lawsuit, I came out and they were celebrating like they\u2019d won the World Series,\u201d Croteau said. \u201cThat experience really will break a person.\u201d\n\nOr in this case, empower them. \n\nCroteau earned a spot on the baseball team at St. Mary\u2019s College of Maryland as a walk-on. She made her debut for the Division III school on March 17, 1989, and drew plenty of headlines. Sports Illustrated wrote a blurb about her under the header, \u201c         Diamond Pioneer.\" \n\n\u201cIt was a great redemption story,\u201d Croteau said.\n\nNext chapter: The movies. \n\nShe was a member of the         Rockford Peaches in a \u201cA League of Their Own.\u201d The Peaches were         one of the teams in the AAGPBL, a league created by Chicago Cubs owner Philip K. Wrigley that started play in 1943. It gave more than 500 women a chance at a baseball career over its 12-year run. \n\nCroteau's main role in the film was to be a stand-in at first base for actor Anne Ramsay during fielding scenes. Both were left handed. The resemblance stopped there, with Croteau donning a black wig to match Ramsay's look.\n\nCroteau did have one speaking part in the film. After the tryout scene inside Wrigley Field, the roster list was posted on a cork board. She ran over, saw her name and exclaimed, \u201cYeah!\u201d before scampering away.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think they were going to keep that in,\u201d she joked.\n\nHer Peaches teammates included Davis, Madonna and         Rosie O'Donnell. Their manager was Hanks, who played Jimmy Dugan.\n\nIn between scenes, Croteau played hacky sack with the other extras. But the real treat was listening to stories from some of the women who played in the AAGPBL and were brought in as advisers. \n\nAs for the movie's most famous line uttered by Hanks' character \u2014 \u201cThere\u2019s no crying in baseball!\u201d \u2014 Croteau had no idea it would become so legendary. In fact, she remembers thinking, \u201dbut there\u2019s tons of crying in baseball.\" \n\nShe's not surprised about the timelessness of a movie that's raked in a cumulative worldwide gross of more than $132 million, according to IMDb.\n\n\u201cIt's an underdog story, because it represents women in culture and also women in sports,\u201d said Croteau, who years later worked with Davis before the actor threw the first pitch at a Baltimore Orioles game (a perfect strike). \u201cIt taps into our humanity.\u201d\n\nCroteau's career was just heating up after filming. She went on to play for the         Colorado Silver Bullets in 1994, with the women\u2019s professional baseball team facing men's amateur and semi-pro squads. Her manager was Hall of Fame pitcher Phil Niekro.\n\nMore history: She and pitcher Lee Anne Ketcham are largely         recognized as the first women  to play with a winter league team sanctioned by Major League Baseball. They were teammates on the Maui Stingrays in the Hawaiian Winter League. Their roster also included current Milwaukee Brewers manager Craig Counsell.\n\nAlong the way, Croteau gave up her glove \u2014 to Cooperstown. Her first-base mitt, along with a photo, are         enshrined in the Baseball Hall of Fame to commemorate her accomplishments. She also served an assistant baseball coach at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst.\n\nSo many baseball memories. But this remains high on the list: An invitation to an AAGPBL reunion, where she met even more of the pioneering women who played in the league that inspired \u201cA League of Their Own.\u201d \n\n\u201cBeing around them,\u201d Croteau said, \u201cjust made me realize how lucky I am.\u201d\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/league-inspired-baseball-pioneer-croteau-70208750", "title": "'A League of Their Own' inspired baseball pioneer Croteau", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 12:50:35 -0400", "summary": "Julie Croteau sometimes felt alone along her historic path as a female baseball player", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_62c8031ee4d64370a092d096749cd728_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/rolling-stones-join-gaga-tv-event-battling-covid-70207754": {"story": "NEW YORK -- \nThe Rolling Stones will join Lady Gaga, Paul McCartney, Stevie Wonder and Billie Eilish for the upcoming TV special aimed at fighting the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAdvocacy organization         Global Citizen  announced Friday that the Stones will appear Saturday on \u201cOne World: Together At Home,\u201d a two-hour televised event that will air at 8 p.m. EDT simultaneously on ABC, NBC, CBS, iHeartMedia and Bell Media networks.\n\nThe Gaga-curated event supports The World Health Organization and will include appearances by Oprah Winfrey, Taylor Swift, Elton John, Jennifer Lopez, David and Victoria Beckham, Alicia Keys, Ellen DeGeneres, Pharrell Williams, Eddie Vedder, Kerry Washington, Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin, Celine Dion, Lizzo, J Balvin and Andrea Bocelli.

After all, one of the primary appeals of sports-in-the-moment is that no one -- participant or spectator -- knows what\u2019s going to unfold, who\u2019s going to win or lose, how and why it\u2019ll happen or even exactly when.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m tired,\u201d President \n lamented this week, \u201cof watching baseball games that are 14 years old.\u201d\n\nSomehow, though, movies, no matter how old, are ripe for watching and re-watching. We're OK with seeing Jimmy Chitwood make that shot ... or Rocky Balboa fight Apollo Creed ... or Roy Hobbs smack a homer into the lights ... or Tom Hanks' character explain there's no crying in baseball ... over and over and over again. Familiarity with the who, what, where doesn\u2019t necessarily spoil the show. \n\nWith all of that in mind, The Associated Press is presenting a one-of-its-kind Top 25 of sports movies, a suggestion of what to put on the screen while stuck at home. This is, of course, what we do at the AP: We rank things. So 70 writers and editors around the world voted on the best in the history of sports cinema.\n\nThe AP Top 25 -- actually, 26 films made the cut, because there was a three-way tie at No. 24 -- was released Friday, with \u201cHoosiers\u201d at No. 1, narrowly ahead of \u201cRocky\u201d and \u201cBull Durham,\u201d which shared the No. 2 spot. \u201cCaddyshack\u201d and \u201cSlap Shot\u201d were next, followed by \u201cField of Dreams,\u201d \u201cRaging Bull,\u201d \u201cMajor League,\u201d \u201cThe Natural\u201d and \u201cA League of Their Own.\u201d\n\nThese, and the rest of the rankings, represent movies that we love -- and that explain our love of sports. \n\nEach Friday until May 22, starting with \u201cA League of Their Own,\u201d we will present stories examining the Top 10 from unique perspectives.\n\n\u201cSomeone once described the challenge of writing a sports film like driving down a road full of potholes of cliches: You\u2019re bound to hit some. You just have to build a vehicle that has a bullet-proof shock absorber, so they\u2019re not noticed,\u201d Angelo Pizzo, who wrote \u201cHoosiers\u201d and another Top 25 selection, \u201cRudy,\u201d said in a telephone interview.\n\n\u201cWhen sports films work, they work because the audience connects emotionally to the protagonist,\u201d Pizzo said. \u201cWhen people talk to me about \u2018Rudy,\u2019 if that movie works for them, it\u2019s because they see themselves in Rudy. They see themselves as someone who is not appreciated, is not seen, is not valued. And by sheer force of will and belief and faith, they manage to break through. It\u2019s not just about achieving the dream -- it\u2019s about going on the journey to achieve the dream.\u201d\n\nSports help us build communities, create a shared history. They speak to how we yearn to win and how we empathize with those who lose. They are capable of filling us with hope and despair, triumph and disaster -- often all four within a span of mere minutes. \n\nMovies, meanwhile, can do the very same. \n\nThey might be profoundly educational or purely entertaining -- and, in the best of cases, both.\n\nWhether it\u2019s in their most life-capturing form, the documentary, such as \u201cHoop Dreams\u201d or \u201cWhen We Were Kings\u201d -- both on the AP list, at No. 14 and tied for No. 21. Or when based on, however strictly or loosely, real events, such as \u201cRemember the Titans\u201d or \u201cThe Pride of the Yankees\u201d -- also in the Top 25, tied for No. 18 and tied for No. 21. Or even when created out of whole cloth, such as \u201cCaddyshack,\u201d which was No. 4, or \u201cThe Natural,\u201d which tied for No. 8. \n\nFilmmaking, no matter the approach, comes with a license to shade and shape, to imagine, to create, to figure out ways to take the audience wherever it needs to go.\n\nMovies and sports share certain constructs, themes or patterns that emerge over and over. \n\nThe heroine/hero. The underdog. Good vs. evil. The protagonist\u2019s path.

But with his name, lyrics that included the N-word and an accompanying video that played on gangsta rap stereotypes, he also drew some anger.\n\n\u201cWhen you start your music video with a parody of hip-hop culture, caricaturing black people, it\u2019s not gonna go over well,\u201d Salima Koroma, director of \u201cBad Rap,\u201d a documentary about Asian-American rappers, said.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of people that I feel like didn\u2019t even want to listen to the music just because of the name,\u201d Imanuel recounted to The Associated Press during an interview at a studio in Los Angeles.\n\nToday, the 20-year-old goes by the name Rich Brian and is showing that he not only has a genuine love for hip-hop culture, but also that he belongs. He became the first Asian rapper to top the iTunes hip-hop chart in 2018 with his album \u201cAmen,\u201d with guest appearances by the likes of Offset and others, and with last year's \u201cSailor,\u201d collaborated with RZA and other key names in hip-hop. \n\nThis month, he released a new song, \"Bali,\" and is hoping to grow his momentum, though planned performances at major festivals like Coachella have been put on hold after concerts were shut down because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very inspired by this (hip-hop), and this is what makes me happy,\u201d he said. \u201cI listened to hip-hop so much \u2026 I feel like this is as long as you know, you pay homage to it, and you know, as long as you respect it, it\u2019s like, I think it\u2019s cool to show that appreciation.\u201d\n\nSince his first viral hit in 2016, Imanuel has racked up billions of views on YouTube, and released two studio albums. \u201cSailor\u201d debuted at the No. 62 spot on the Billboard 200 albums chart last year.\n\nImmanuel isn't huge in the United States, but he\u2019s making inroads. He spends a lot of time in Los Angeles, thanks to Sean Miyashiro, the founder of the Asian-centric label 88rising. The Los Angeles native flew Immanuel to the United States, getting permission from the rapper\u2019s parents, after seeing \u201cDat $tick\u201d and becoming mesmerized.\n\n\u201cThe look was crazy. And he could rap,\u201d Miyashiro, a former concert promoter, told Associated Press.\n\nBut Miyashiro knew Immanuel had several obstacles to finding success here, chief among them his problematic rap name and the claims of cultural appropriation that dogged him. \n\nHe\u2019s not the only Asian star to face such accusations \u2014 K-pop bands like Big Bang and Chinese artist Kris Wu are among many. Even Awkwafina, the Asian-American star who started off as a rapper before finding success as an actress in \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d and last year\u2019s acclaimed \u201cFarewell,\u201d has been criticized for speaking in \u201cblaccent\u201d and acting with exaggerated mannerisms that some feel play black stereotypes. \n\nHip-hop has been exported all over the world, from Bollywood film to K-pop songs. But Koroma says \u201chip-hop culture, and by way of association, black culture\u201d often get effaced and misrepresented.\n\n\u201cA lot of Asian rappers do appropriate, to be honest. And there\u2019s a lot of appropriation in back and forth,\u201d Miyashiro said.\n\nMiyashiro added that virtually anyone anywhere can be inspired by hip-hop, but the key is to respect and appreciate the history and message of hip hop. To that end, Immanuel changed his name in 2018 to Rich Brian and apologized for his mistakes on social media.\n\nThe growth was made clear on last year's \u201cSailor.\" Imanuel called it his \u201cpersonal journey\u201d \u2013 with stories of his move across the continent and life away from home.\n\nOne of his songs, \u201cKids,\u201d is an ode to people like himself \u201cwho immigrated and left their countries to pursue something better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI feel like I would be too scared to do it. But at the time, I don\u2019t remember being scared,\u201d said Imanuel as he recounted his experience of coming to America without his family. \u201cMy dream was just like so big. And I was just following this huge dream that I didn\u2019t have time to be scared.\u201d\n\nImanuel, who has collaborated with artists ranging from K-pop stars to Chinese and American rappers, said his goal is to focus on the unique side of himself and inspire others to do the same. His message is already engraved on \u201cKids\u201d \u2013 \u201cTell these Asian kids they could do what they want. Might steal that mic at the Grammys just to say we won. That everyone can make it, don\u2019t matter where you from.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nAP entertainment journalist Amanda Lee Myers contributed to this report from Los Angeles.\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/asian-rapper-rich-brian-proving-belongs-hip-hop-70206075", "title": "Asian rapper Rich Brian is proving he belongs in hip-hop", "published": "Fri, 17 Apr 2020 09:53:48 -0400", "summary": "When Rich Brian first started rapping, he was just a teen in Indonesia looking to make waves on SoundCloud", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_c4e1eadd54744bf8bfb694c2e422082d_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/criterion-channel-programming-movable-movie-feast-70194103": {"story": "NEW YORK -- \nArthouses are closed. Film festivals are canceled. But double features, matinees and film series continue to run unabated in one vital, virtual corner of moviedom.\n\nThe         Criterion Channel, the year-old streaming service, is a hotbed of cinephilia in the best of times. Right now, it\u2019s about as close as you can get to actually going to the movies. Whereas other streamers supply expansive oceans of \u201ccontent,\u201d the Criterion Channel pools its movies into collections, double-bills and night-by-night selections. Algorithms aren't welcome.\n\n\u201cInstead of isolating each other in our own preferences, we\u2019re coming together around different themes and programs,\u201d says Peter Becker, the energetic president of the Criterion Collection. \u201cI think people can feel that there\u2019s people behind this programming. This is a service that\u2019s programmed by people, for people.\"\n\nThe Criterion Channel, which launched last year in the wake of the shuttering of         the Turner Classic Movies-Criterion Collection collaboration Filmstruck, is the streaming arm of the Criterion Collection, the highly regarded maker of robust Blu-rays of classic and international movies. \n\nIn its first year, the Criterion Channel has quickly accrued the kind of devoted fanbase that belonged to Filmstruck, the death of which spawned an outcry from Steven Spielberg, Martin Scorsese and         dozens of other filmmakers. Wes Anderson, in         a recent piece of fan mail, called the Criterion Channel a \u201cLouvre of movies.\u201d Its many avid viewers include Barry Jenkins, Rian Johnson, Sofia Coppola, Josh and Benny Safdie \u2014 and most movie buffs that can afford $10.99 a month. \n\nFor quarantined moviegoers, the Criterion Channel is like a warm hearth to gather around while huddled inside. Becker says that in the weeks since lockdown orders began, watching has doubled on the service. \n\nLike a cinema, Criterion Channel has its own weekly listings. Friday nights are for double features. Wednesday belongs to female filmmakers. Matinees of family-friendly movies debut on Saturday. Shorts get showcased Tuesday. And of course, you can sift through and select at will. \n\nBut part of the pleasure of the Criterion Channel is not having to meander through a digital sea of choices. The bedrock of the Criterion Channel, like any repertory cinema, are its series. There have been collections of \u201970 sci-fi, films with the scores by Quincy Jones, a centennial celebration of the great Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune, heist movies and pre-code Barbara Stanwyck films.\n\nMost series come with a mix of familiar titles and deep cuts, offering both primers for beginners and discovery for more die-hards. For Criterion\u2019s anniversary, it brought back its inaugural series, Columbia Noir, which pulls together some of the studio\u2019s most heralded film noirs (\u201cIn a Lonely Place,\u201d \u201cGilda\u201d) along with gems ripe for rediscovery (\u201cMy Name Is Julia Ross,\u201d \u201cMurder by Contract\u201d). Most collections include video introductions and other supplemental material.\n\n\u201cWith the curated collections and the double features and all those ways of presenting the films, the movies feel accessible and they\u2019re contextualized,\u201d says Penelope Bartlett, the channel\u2019s programmer. \u201cThere are some good films on other platforms but they\u2019re just there, floating, without much context.\u201d\n\nBartlett oversees programming but ideas can come from anywhere \u2014 other Criterion staffers and sometimes the critics and writers who regularly contribute essays and interviews to the service, like Farran Nehme and Imogen Sara Smith. At a film festival, Becker recalls, \u201cImogen said the words \u2018Western Noir\u2019 and I thought, \u2018Oh, Imogen, that sounds fun. Tell me about that.\u2019\u201d\n\nSometimes the series are inspired by simple curiosity \u2014 wanting to know Jean Arthur\u2019s filmography better \u2014 or a desire to expand the interest of others. A series in May is planned on trailblazing screenwriter Francis Marion (\u201cDinner at Eight,\u201d \u201cThe Big House\u201d). The digital format and the extensive Janus Films library also offer the chance of spontaneity. When the celebrated Swedish actor Max von Sydow         died in March, Criterion gathered together 15 of his films.\n\n\u201cMy shtick is I send Penelope emails, usually very late at night when I\u2019ve gone down a rabbit hole, and they have one word with an exclamation point,\u201d says Becker. \u201cI started with, like, \u2018Caught on Tape!\u2019 (a series of surveillance paranoia, like Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s \u201cThe Conversation\u201d) or \u2018Heist movies!\u2019\u201d\n\nBecker declined to share subscriber numbers for the Criterion Channel, which is available in the U.S. and Canada. But he said he couldn\u2019t be more pleased with its growth, and he\u2019s happy for it to occupy a humble space amid much larger streaming-service battles. When WarnerMedia, which is preparing the launch of HBO Max, canceled Filmstruck, the company deemed it \u201ca niche service.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are still very niche. Being niche is not something that huge corporations necessarily want to be,\u201d says Becker. \u201cBut we wear it as a badge of honor in certain way. We\u2019re sticking with what we believe in.\u201d\n\nFor Becker, the Criterion Channel also works in tandem with movie theaters. Movies are meant to be seen on the big screen, he insists \u2014 an unusual perspective for a DVD and streaming company. But it\u2019s that passionate affection for cinema that makes Criterion what it is. \n\nLike Filmstruck did, the Channel features documentary portraits of arthouse theaters nationwide. Support of them is essential during the pandemic, Becker says, which is why the Criterion Collection helped launch         a crowd-sourced relief fund for arthouse theaters. In two weeks, it\u2019s raised nearly $400,000. \n\nBartlett says the Channel is weighing other measures, possibly hosting films that had their festival premieres canceled or the planned series of shuttered arthouses. It's one more way that Criterion is fulfilling its role as a lifeblood for the movie lover.\n\n\u201cThe whole point of being a good curator is to suggest some stuff that may light up some of your audience and infuriate other parts of your audience,\u201d says Becker. \u201cYou have to risk failure to qualify for discovery. So we\u2019re trying to encourage people to be bold and exploratory.\u201d\n\nThe ideas keep coming. The other night, Becker, contemplating the trials of the housebound, sent Bartlett another one-word email.

He was 81.\n\nDennehy died Wednesday night of natural causes in New Haven, Connecticut, according to Kate Cafaro of ICM Partners, the actor's representatives.\n\nKnown for his broad frame, booming voice and ability to play good guys and bad guys with equal aplomb, Dennehy won two Tony Awards, a Golden Globe, a Laurence Olivier Award and was nominated for six Emmys. He was inducted into the American Theater Hall of Fame in 2010.\n\nTributes came from Hollywood and Broadway, including from Lin-Manuel Miranda, who said he saw Dennehy twice onstage and called the actor \u201ca colossus.\u201d Actor Michael McKean said Dennehy was \u201cbrilliant and versatile, a powerhouse actor and a very nice man as well.\u201d Dana Delany, who appeared in a movie with Dennehy, said: \u201cThey don\u2019t make his kind anymore.\u201d\n\nAmong his 40-odd films, he played a sheriff who jailed Rambo in \u201cFirst Blood,\u201d a serial killer in \u201cTo Catch a Killer,\u201d and a corrupt sheriff gunned down by Kevin Kline in \u201cSilverado.\u201d He also had some benign roles: the bartender who consoles Dudley Moore in \u201c10\u201d and the levelheaded leader of aliens in \u201cCocoon\u201d and its sequel. \n\n\u201cThe world has lost a great artist,\u201d Sylvester Stallone wrote in tribute on Twitter, saying Dennehy helped him build the character of Rambo.\n\nEventually Dennehy wearied of the studio life. \u201cMovies used to be fun,\u201d he observed in an interview. \u201cThey took care of you, first-class. Those days are gone.\u201d\n\nDennehy had a long connection with Chicago\u2019s Goodman Theater, which had a reputation for heavy drama. He appeared in Bertolt Brecht\u2019s \u201cGalileo\u201d in 1986 and later Chekhov\u2019s \u201cCherry Orchard\u201d at far lower salaries than he earned in Hollywood. In 1990 he played the role of Hickey in Eugene O\u2019Neill\u2019s \u201cThe Iceman Cometh,\u201d a play he reprised at the Goodman with Nathan Lane in 2012 and in Brooklyn in 2015.\n\nIn 1998, Dennehy appeared on Broadway in the classic role of Willy Loman, the worn-out hustler in Miller\u2019s \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d and won the Tony for his performance.\n\n\u201cWhat this actor goes for is close to an everyman quality, with a grand emotional expansiveness that matches his monumental physique,\u201d wrote Ben Brantley in his review of the play for The New York Times. \u201cYet these emotions ring so unerringly true that Mr. Dennehy seems to kidnap you by force, trapping you inside Willy\u2019s psyche.\u201d\n\nHe was awarded another Tony in 2003 for his role in O\u2019Neill\u2019s \u201cLong Day\u2019s Journey into Night,\u201d opposite Vanessa Redgrave, Phillip Seymour Hoffman and Robert Sean Leonard. \n\nAt the podium, after thanking his family, co-stars and producers and complementing his competitors, he said: \u201cThe words of Eugene O\u2019Neill \u2014 they\u2019ve got to be heard. They\u2019ve got to be heard, and heard and heard. And thank you so much for giving us the chance to enunciate them.\u201d\n\nDennehy was born July 9, 1938, in Bridgeport, Connecticut, the first of three sons. His venture into acting began when he was 14 in New York City and a student at a Brooklyn high school. He acted the title role in \u201cMacbeth.\u201d He played football on a scholarship at Columbia University, and he served five years in the U.S. Marines.\n\nBack in New York City in 1965, he pursued acting while working at side jobs. \u201cI learned first-hand how a truck driver lives, what a bartender does, how a salesman thinks,\u201d he told The New York Times in 1989. \u201cI had to make a life inside those jobs, not just pretend.\u201d\n\nHis parents \u2014 Ed Dennehy, an editor for The Associated Press in New York, and Hannah Dennehy, a nurse \u2014 could never understand why their son chose to act. \u201cAnyone raised in a first or second generation immigrant family knows that you are expected to advance the ball down the field,\u201d Dennehy told Columbia College Today in 1999. \u201cActing didn\u2019t qualify in any way.\u201d\n\nThe 6-foot-3-inch Dennehy went to Hollywood for his first movie, \u201cSemi-Tough\u201d starring Burt Reynolds and Kris Kristofferson. Dennehy was paid $10,000 a week for 10 week\u2019s work, which he thought \u201clooked like it was all the money in the world.\u201d He became a professional actor at the age of 38.\n\nAmong his films: \u201cLooking for Mr. Goodbar,\u201d \u201cFoul Play,\u201d \u201cLittle Miss Marker,\u201d \u201cSplit Image,\u201d \u201cGorky Park,\u201d \u201cLegal Eagles,\u201d \u201cMiles from Home,\u201d \u201cReturn to Snowy River,\u201d \u201cPresumed Innocent,\u201d \u201cRomeo and Juliet\u201d and \u201cAssault on Precinct 13.\u201d He played the father of Chris Farley\u2019s titular character in the 1995 comedy \u201cTommy Boy.\u201d\n\nHe played serial murderer John Wayne Gacy in the 1991 TV movie \u201cTo Catch a Killer\u201d and union leader Jackie Presser in the HBO special \u201cTeamster Boss\u201d a year later. \u201cI try to play villains as if they\u2019re good guys and good guys as if they\u2019re villains,\u201d he said in 1992\n\nHe worked deep into his 70s, in such projects as SundanceTV\u2019s \u201cHap and Leonard,\u201d the film \u201cThe Seagull\u201d with Elisabeth Moss and Annette Bening and the play \u201cEndgame\u201d by Samuel Beckett at the Long Wharf Theatre. His last foray on Broadway was in \u201cLove Letters\u201d opposite Mia Farrow in 2014.\n\n\u201cJust devastated to learn that the magnificent Brian Dennehy has died. There is no one I enjoyed working with more. And there are few friends as valued in my life,\u201d Farrow wrote Thursday.\n\nOther tributes came from Treat Williams, who wrote: \u201cA great great actor has passed\u201d and Josh Gad, who said Dennehy's performance in \u201cDeath of a Salesman\u201d will go down as one of the crowning performances ever delivered on stage.\n\nHe is survived by his second wife, costume designer Jennifer Arnott and their two children, Cormac and Sarah. He also is survived by three daughters \u2014 Elizabeth, Kathleen and Deirdre \u2014 from a previous marriage to Judith Scheff.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMark Kennedy is at         http://twitter.com/KennedyTwits     \n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/brian-dennehy-tony-winning-stage-screen-actor-dies-70188536", "title": "Actor Brian Dennehy, who starred in 'Tommy Boy,' dies at 81", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 18:06:37 -0400", "summary": "Brian Dennehy, the burly actor who started in films as a macho heavy and later won plaudits for his stage work in plays by Shakespeare, Chekhov, Eugene O&rsquo;Neill and Arthur Miller, has died", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_3b5d4f525d9d4247bad82185b061e65c_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/cinematographer-allen-daviau-died-77-70191076": {"story": "LOS ANGELES -- \nCinematographer Allen Daviau, who shot three of Steven Spielberg\u2019s films including \u201cE.T. The Extra-Terrestrial,\u201d has died. A representative from the American Society of Cinematographers said Wednesday that Daviau died Tuesday of complications from COVID-19. He was 77. \n\nA five-time Oscar nominee, Daviau was also behind the camera on \u201cEmpire of the Sun,\u201d \u201cBugsy,\u201d \u201cThe Color Purple,\u201d \u201cAvalon\u201d and \u201cDefending Your Life.\u201d\n\nSpielberg said in a statement that, \"Allen was a wonderful artist but his warmth and humanity were as powerful as his lens. He was a singular talent and a beautiful human being.\u201d The director had sent a letter to his old friend upon hearing of his struggle with the virus that was read to him several times at his bedside. \n\nASC president Kees van Oostrum wrote in an email to members Wednesday that Daviau \u201cWill be remembered fondly for his sense of humor, his taste for the best of foods and his laugh that unmistakably marked his presence from far away.\u201d \n\nBorn in New Orleans in 1942 and raised in the Los Angeles area, Daviau said seeing color television at the age of 12 began his fascination with the technology of light and photography, working at camera stores and film labs to hone his skills. He \u201cgate-crashed\u201d the set of Marlon Brando\u2019s \u201cOne-Eyed Jacks,\u201d shot early music videos for The Who and Jimi Hendrix and also shot still photography for The Monkees. \n\nHe met Spielberg in 1967 and discovered a shared love of movies. Spielberg later said that his 8mm and 16mm films \u201cweren\u2019t doing the trick\u201d to help him break into the business and he started collaborating with Daviau. Together they shot \u201cAmblin\u201d in 1968. \n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know how crazy we are today about our individual work in that film, but I always think of Allen as a terrifically versatile cinematographer,\u201d Spielberg later told American Cinematographer magazine. \n\nThey wouldn\u2019t officially work together until years later, with \u201cE.T.\u201d from 1982. Daviau said, \u201cIt was the greatest opportunity anyone could ever wish for.\u201d Not only was the film an enormous commercial success, but it earned Daviau his first Academy Award nomination. \n\nHe would go on to work with Spielberg many times, including serving as the director of photography on the films \u201cThe Color Purple\u201d and \u201cEmpire of the Sun,\u201d as well as an episode of the series \u201cAmazing Stories.\u201d He also shot second unit footage on \u201cIndiana Jones and the Temple of Doom.\"\n\nDaviau also had a fruitful relationship with Barry Levinson on \u201cBugsy\u201d and \u201cAvalon,\" both of which scored him additional Oscar nominations.\n\nHis feature output slowed in the later 90s, when he was doing more commercial work, although he did shoot \u201cCongo\u201d and \u201cThe Astronaut's Wife.\u201d \n\nA surgical procedure in 2012 left Daviau confined to a wheelchair, and he moved in to the a facility run by Motion Picture and Television Fund in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. He was receiving treatment at a nearby hospital for COVID-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, but was returned to the MPTF home to spend his final days, the facility's President & CEO Bob Beitcher wrote in a remembrance. \n\nAlthough he never won the Oscar, Daviau did win a BAFTA for his work on \u201cEmpire of the Sun,\" which he said was his favorite film to work on, and in 2007 was awarded a lifetime achievement award from the American Society of Cinematographers. \n\nHe summed up his work in a humorous comment in 1987. \n\n\u201cThe cinematographer\u2019s unique perversity is that in this absolutely chaotic, screwed up, very imperfect work, within the frame everything\u2019s perfect for an instant,\" Daviau said.\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/cinematographer-allen-daviau-died-77-70191076", "title": "\u2018E.T.,\u2019 'Bugsy' cinematographer Allen Daviau dies at 77", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 17:06:04 -0400", "summary": "Cinematographer Allen Daviau, who shot three of Steven Spielberg&rsquo;s films including &ldquo;E", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_4f09361992084ff58e560155d8663ec4_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/best-sellers-books-usatoday-70192719": {"story": "\n1. \u201cMagnolia Table, Vol. 2\" by Joanna Gaines (Morrow Cookbooks)\n\n2. \u201cLittle Fires Everywhere\u201d by Celeste Ng (Penguin)\n\n3. \u201cWhere the Crawdads Sing\u201d by Delia Owens (G.

Jordan appeared on the show via video conference from his home in Florida to promote the \u201cThe Last Dance,\u201d a 10-part documentary series focused on the final year of the 90\u2032s Bulls dynasty that won six NBA titles in eight years.\n\n\u201cThe beginning of the season, it started when (general manager) Jerry Krause told (coach) Phil Jackson that he could go 82-0 and he would never get a chance to come back,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cKnowing that I had married myself to him, and if he wasn\u2019t going to be the coach, then obviously I wasn\u2019t going to play. So Phil started off the season saying this was the last dance \u2014 and we played it that way.\u201d\n\nThe series will debut Sunday night on ESPN in the United States and on Netflix internationally over five consecutive Sundays through May 17. There will be two hour-long episodes each of those nights.\n\nJordan said Thursday that after Jackson told the team it was to be the final season together, the Bulls focused on completing the task of a second three-peat.\n\n\u201cMentally it tugged at you that this had to come to an end, but it also centered our focus to making sure we ended it right,\u201d Jordan said. \"As sad as it sounded at the beginning of the year, we tried to rejoice and enjoy the year and finish it off the right way.\u201d\n\nThe documentary was originally scheduled to be released in June during the NBA Finals, but         ESPN made the decision to accelerate its release due to the lack of live sports programming because of the coronavirus pandemic. The series has been billed to include never-before-seen footage from that season, during which the team chased its sixth championship.\n\nBut the documentary covers more than just the final season.\n\nThe documentary shows Bulls owner Jerry Reinsdorf and Jordan arguing about a foot injury he suffered during his second NBA season.\n\nJordan wanted to play through the injury after doctors told the team there was a 90% chance he would recover.\n\nReinsdorf, however, did not want the star guard to play for fear it might ruin his career.\n\n\u201cI said to Michael, you\u2019re not thinking about the risk-reward ratio,\u201d Reinsforf said in the clip aired by GMA. \u201cIf you had a terrible headache and I gave you a bottle of pills and nine of the pills would cure you and one of the pills would kill you, would you take a pill?\u201d\n\nJordan replied that \u201cit depends on how (expletive) bad the headache is.\u201d\n\nReinsdorf ultimately won out; Jordan sat out 64 games that season before returning for the playoffs.\n\nJordan also talks about his time at the University of North Carolina where he would write his mother asking for money for postage stamps so he could send her letters and to pay his phone bill.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little different today,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cI had a phone bill in college that was $60 or less, but I only had $20 in my account. The thing that people will learn, and my kids will laugh about when they see it, is we used postage stamps back in those days. Looking at the video you will see things that people have forgot, that life was this way.\n\n\u201cWe didn\u2019t have Instagram or Twitter, so you had to live life as it came. ... Spending time with friends and family, it wasn\u2019t the phone. It was in presence \u2014 and you wrote letters.\u201d\n\nJordan discussed his parents during the interview with Good Morning America, saying they were the biggest influence in his life. He said he learned many valuable lessons from them, including the ability to learn from the negatives in life and turn them into positives.\n\nHe also praised his older brother, Larry.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t be here if it wasn\u2019t for my brother Larry,\u201d Jordan said. \"Larry pushed me. We used to fight after every game. But through that fight emerged someone like me. He\u2019s right next to me and supports me.\u201d\n\nThe series will also include extensive profiles of Jackson, and some of Jordan\u2019s key teammates, including Scottie Pippen, Dennis Rodman and Steve Kerr.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\n\nMore AP NBA coverage: https://apnews.com/NBA and https://twitter.com/AP\u2014Sports\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/jordan-winning-6th-nba-title-bulls-year-70180391", "title": "Jordan: Winning 6th NBA title with Bulls was 'trying year'", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 16:15:55 -0400", "summary": "Michael Jordan says his final NBA championship season with the Chicago Bulls as a &ldquo;trying year.&rdquo;", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_ed336f89f1df48e4b35ba34036650837_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/sudan-protest-image-wins-prestigious-world-press-photo-70192474": {"story": "THE HAGUE, Netherlands -- \nAn emotion-charged photo of a young man illuminated by cellphone lights as he recites poetry amid a crowd of protesters calling for civilian rule in Sudan won the prestigious World Press Photo award on Thursday.\n\nThe image, titled \u201cStraight Voice,\u201d was captured by Japanese photographer Yasuyoshi Chiba, in Khartoum on June 19 last year. Chiba is Chief Photographer for East Africa and Indian Ocean for French news agency Agence France-Presse.

The series also was one of three nominations for Story of the Year and one of the images was among six nominations for the World Press Photo award.\n\nThe Boeing 737 MAX crashed into a field shortly after take-off, killing all 157 passengers and crew.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s truly an honor to have Associated Press (AP) photographs included among the winners of this year\u2019s World Press Photo contest,\u201d said AP\u2019s Director of Photography, J.

The series also won the Long-Term Projects category.\n\nThe closing date for entries was Jan. 14, before the coronavirus outbreak gripped the globe and began dominating news coverage. In all, 4,282 photographers submitted just under 74,000 photos. The 44 winners came from 24 different countries, organizers said.\n\nEsther Horvath of Hungary won the Environment Singles category with a photo for The New York Times of a polar bear and her cub near equipment placed by scientists investigating the consequences of Arctic climate change. AP photographer Noah Berger won second prize with an aerial image of firefighters battling the Marsh Complex Fire, near the town of Brentwood, California.\n\nCanadian Mark Blinch won the Sports Singles top prize with a dramatic image for NBAE of Toronto Raptors player Kawhi Leonard watching his match-winning, buzzer-beating shot drop into the net to defeat the Philadelphia 76ers in Game 7 of the NBA\u2019s Eastern Conference Semifinals.\n\nAP photographer Silvia Izquierdo won second prize with an image of fans of Brazilian soccer team Flamengo cheering a goal against River Plate of Argentina in the final of the Copa Libertadores. The fans were watching the match on giant screens at Rio de Janeiro's Maracan\u00e3 Stadium.\n\nAnother AP photographer, Ramon Espinosa, won third prize in the Spot News Singles category for an image of people wading along a flooded road in Freeport, Grand Bahama, after Hurricane Dorian pummeled the island.

Still, in March, they were able to get a co-signer and became proud homeowners of a fixer upper in Nashville, Tenn.\n\nBut in a matter of days, up to 85% of their income was wiped out due to the coronavirus pandemic. \n\n\"We immediately had to cancel 38 U.S. dates. ... And we\u2019ve lost an entire U.K. and European tour. For us, that\u2019s pretty much all of our income,\u201d Doug Williams said. \n\nSo now, like many other independent musicians, they've turned to social media and the Internet to make up their lost wages. A Facebook live concert from the Williams\u2019 new home drew about 300 people and $800 in donations, or about what they\u2019d take in on a night on tour. Since then, it\u2019s received another 4,000 views.\n\nWhile plenty of A-list musicians have responded to the pandemic with virtual performances to entertain their fans, for entertainers with less name recognition, reaching out via social media or the web is a matter of survival. And it's not just the concerts. They sell merchandise, music and anything else to pay the bills.\n\nChanges in the music industry have made it harder for artists to survive, said Rob Miller, owner of Chicago-based independent label         Bloodshot Records.\n\n\u201cSales do not drive a career the way they used to, so it's more imperative than ever for artists to stay out on the road. And right now we're not talking about a diminishment of income, we're talking about a cessation of it. It's done. And no one can tell us for how long,\u201d Miller said.\n\nEvery Saturday, Canadian singer         Dan Mangan is performing a ticketed online show. It costs $6 and he's donating all proceeds to charity, including a food bank and a domestic abuse shelter.\n\n\u201cAnd I do like the road, but I'd be better at home,\u201d Mangan sang from the song \u201cPine For Cedars,\u201d which he wrote more than a decade ago.\n\nWhile he's personally not taking money from the basement shows \u2014 for now \u2014 he's using a project called Side Door to help other artists earn income from ticketed online shows.\n\n\u201cI wanted to set a tone that it's OK to charge for a show, regardless of where the money's going. At the same time I'm thinking, \u2018Well, I\u2019m going to be OK. I've got some savings,'\" Mangan said. \"But it did occur to me that if this goes on for a long time, I might have to adjust my thinking and maybe I can only give away half the proceeds, or maybe have to start keeping the proceeds.\"\n\nAnd fans appreciate it. Mike Murphy, a Washington, D.C.-based lawyer, said he and his wife usually see a couple of hundred bands live each year, and they keep a list of the artists. That, of course, isn\u2019t happening now. Instead, Murphy and his wife are watching their favorite musicians perform from their living rooms as they sit in theirs.\n\n\u201cI watch as much as I can and give as much as I can,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI\u2019m directing my charitable giving to the musicians of the world.\u201d\n\nLike the rest of society, musicians are reacting in different ways. A.J. Haynes, singer and guitarist of the Louisiana-based         Seratones, is scared and stressed. She\u2019s trying to process what COVID-19 means to the world as a whole, her friends and herself.\n\nBut that also means stepping back. While she's still writing poetry, her message to others isn't necessarily coming through song. Not at the moment.\n\n\u201cThe emotional stress and severe uncertainty is just taxing,\u201d Haynes said. \u201cI've just honestly been overwhelmed. This is a (expletive) global crisis. I'm sorry if I don't want to livestream from my living room all day ... The reality is I'm not OK right now, and I'm not going to pretend as if I am.\u201d\n\nBloodshot Records' Miller also gets that, and urges people to buy an album, a T-shirt or watch a livestream and tip to support independent musicians. And if that's not possible, even a listen can help.\n\n\u201cThey're performers. They want to be in front of a crowd,\u201d Miller said. \u201cLet them know you\u2019re watching. Let them know that it meant something to you.\"\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/independent-musicians-turn-social-media-recoup-wages-70186677", "title": "Independent musicians turn to social media to recoup wages", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 15:30:20 -0400", "summary": "It's not just A-list stars providing entertainment on social media", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_427e4722f5144324b8dd2a6199704789_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/top-20-global-concert-tours-pollstar-70190026": {"story": "\nThe Top 20 Global Concert Tours ranks artists by average box office gross per city and includes the average ticket price for shows Worldwide.

Not so much.\n\nTwo years after becoming an unlikely singing sensation, the 34-year-old doctor with a golden voice is releasing his first-ever EP on Friday and all the proceeds will be donated to         The Center of Disaster Philanthropy COVID-19 Response Fund.     \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such a unique time in all of our lives. I\u2019m just honored to be able to share a bit of music with people, especially during these trying times,\u201d Francois said in an interview with The Associated Press on Wednesday. \u201cWhat we do as surgeons, what we do as physicians goes a very long way, but music moves people in a way that medicine can\u2019t.\u201d\n\nFrancois has appeared on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show,\u201d CNN, \u201cGood Morning America\u201d and more programs after becoming popular for singing booming covers of         John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine\u201d and         Bill Withers\u2019 \u201cLean On Me,\u201d but just weeks ago he got a call from two executives from the Nashville-based         Big Machine Label Group, asking how they could help him spread his message of hope and joy through music.\n\nJake Basden and Allison Jones pulled their resources together, helping Francois get into a recording studio to record the four-song EP called \u201cMusic Is Medicine,\u201d which is being independently released on the newly formed Doctor Elvis Records. Fellow resident William Robinson, who usually accompanies Francois on piano during his performances, joined in for the recording sessions of \u201cImagine,\u201d \u201cLean on Me,\u201d Andra Day\u2019s \u201cRise Up\u201d and         Mike Yung\u2019s \u201cAlright.\u201d     \n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been a group of people trying to use music to help people,\u201d Francois said of all the help he\u2019s received to make the EP. \u201cI think that\u2019s probably the most special thing about it.\u201d\n\nFrancois also knew the EP could be a good way to help raise funds to fight the spreading coronavirus and honor the health care workers on the frontlines.\n\n\u201cWe see health care providers who are getting impacted. We see our colleagues who are in the ICUs. We see our colleagues who are in the emergency department. We see how much need there is on the side of patients and on the side of providers. ... I felt like the one thing we could do, if anything, was to use this momentum and use this energy to give,\u201d he said.\n\nFrancois, who is in his last year of residency at the         Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, began singing in high school and in church but he never took it seriously. Medicine, however, was always on his mind.\n\nHe grew up in Miami and New York and said trips to Haiti, where his family is from, really helped him find his life goal.\n\n\u201cI just always remember seeing long lines of people and how grateful they were to get Tylenol for free, or how grateful they were being able to just literally speak to a doctor and get their advice,\u201d he recalled. \u201cSince then, maybe when I was like 7 or 8, I\u2019ve always looked at that as being something that I\u2019d want to give the rest of my life to.\u201d\n\nBut singing has helped him to connect to patients, and fans around the world, in a different way. He remembers going viral after posting a cover of \u201cImagine,\u201d surprised that people outside of the U.S. saw and enjoyed the clip.\n\n\u201cMy dad got a phone call from a relative in France who came across the video and that\u2019s when I was like, \u2018Oh wow!\u2019 It hadn\u2019t even been 24 hours,\u201d he recalled. \u201cI\u2019ll get messages from nurses in Italy or messages from other residents and other health care providers or patients ... A little bit of good can literally cross oceans and move people across the world.\u201d\n\nOnce Francois finishes his residency, he\u2019s heading to         Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, the teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School, to complete a fellowship in spine surgery.\n\nStill, it feels surreal that he will have an album out on digital platforms next to releases from pop, rap and rock stars.\n\n\u201cSpotify, iTunes, Amazon? That\u2019s just crazy. Literally if you asked me a month ago, I would probably laugh at you. Like, I\u2019ve never even recorded a song,\u201d Francois said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to pinch myself, \u2018Is this actually real?\u2019 Seeing it all come together, it just feels like a dream,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the coolest thing about it is it\u2019s a dream where we are all able to give our small parts to make the world better.\u201d\n", "link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/singing-surgeon-dr-elvis-cuts-ep-aid-covid-70185424", "title": "Singing Surgeon: Dr. Elvis cuts EP to aid COVID-19 fund", "published": "Thu, 16 Apr 2020 12:49:09 -0400", "summary": "Elvis Francois, the orthopedic surgery resident who has gone viral with his top-notch live performances at hospitals, knew from adolescence he wanted to help heal the world through medicine", "pic": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/WireAP_f313602a83814143979031aea07727ba_16x9_992.jpg"}, "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/wireStory/amid-lockdown-danes-find-celebrate-queens-birthday-70181121": {"story": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark -- \nObserving social distancing, Danes on Thursday sang birthday songs from homes, balconies, parks and public gardens to honor popular Queen Margrethe II, who turned 80 amid the pandemic lockdown.\n\nThe festivities were shown live by the country's two public broadcasters, DR and TV2, which aired footage of flag-waving people singing the Danish version of \u201cHappy Birthday,\u201d playing instruments and cheering.
